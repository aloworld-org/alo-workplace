//! In-memory cache of rendered sites, keyed by canonical public host and validated by
//! publish id. Every request still performs the one indexed resolver read —
//! that is what makes a republish (or unpublish) visible immediately — but
//! rendering is done once per publish, not per request: a cache entry is a
//! hit only while its publish id matches what the resolver just returned,
//! so serving stale content is impossible by construction.
