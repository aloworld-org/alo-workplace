# alo Mail — loop journal

Track opened 2026-08-26. Queue derived from the open mail lines of ROADMAP.md
after the 2026-08-25 audit trued them up; the engine itself (SMTP + trust
stack, JMAP on 443, IMAP/POP3, CardDAV, filters, out-of-office scheduling,
per-identity signatures) is done, live, and wire-verified — this track builds
the tail between "works" and "a business runs on it".

Standing facts every iteration should know:

- MAPI is retired by decision (ADR 0056). Nothing here touches it.
- Another agent (Codex) is actively reworking web/src/ds, web/src/billing,
  web/src/chat and some web/src/mail components in its own checkout. Backend
  items are ordered first for this reason; rebase early, keep both sides of
  additive i18n conflicts.
- Migrations for this track: 09xx, append-only, expand-only.
- Deploys are the human's. Build, test, commit, push — nothing else.
