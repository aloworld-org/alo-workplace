# alo design system — migration journal

One entry per completed queue item: what was migrated, what the ratchet said
before and after, and anything the adoption changed about how a screen looks.

Started 2026-08-12 with 43 stylesheets on `web/src/ds/redefined.ts`, of which
one — `sites/SitesModule.module.css` — belongs to another track and is not this
queue's to take.

**A screen that looks worse after adopting a shared component is a finding, not
a licence to redesign.** Record it here and keep going; a redesign inside a
migration commit makes an intended change indistinguishable from a regression.

## D1.01 — `Card`

Twelve copies reconciled. They agreed on the idea and on nothing else: padding
from `--space-4` to `--space-8` and, in two of them, a hardcoded `10px 12px`;
radius md through xl; shadow absent, `sm`, `md`, or a hand-mixed
`rgba(40, 30, 20, 0.04)`. **`crm` and `hr` were byte-identical**, hardcoded
values included — copied from one to the other, which is honestly how most of
this happened.

Took the most token-clean build and kept the real differences as `pad`
(`sm`/`md`/`lg`), `flat` for a card inside another surface, and `interactive`
for one that is genuinely clickable. Hover states on things that do not respond
to a click are a promise the screen does not keep, so that one is opt-in.

## D1.02 — `Badge` and `Chip`

The copies had blurred the distinction, so it is now stated in the file:
**a badge is read, a chip is acted on.** "Admin" beside a name is a badge; a
recipient you can remove is a chip. If it contains a button, it is a chip.

Several chips carried asymmetric padding — `0 3px 0 var(--space-2)` — to make
room for a trailing remove button each caller drew itself. The component owns
that now, and the remove button takes a label naming *what* it removes, because
a row of buttons all called "Remove" is useless read aloud.

Badge tones are named rather than left to the caller, and the file records that
a tone must never be the only signal: colour alone is invisible to somebody who
cannot distinguish it.

**Next:** D1.03 `Table`.
