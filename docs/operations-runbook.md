# alo mail — operations runbook

Plain-language guide to running the live alo mail server. It assumes no
deep technical background: every task is "here's what it means, here's the
exact command, here's how you know it worked."

- **Server:** one Linux host at `mail.namel3ss.com`.
- **What it does:** receives mail, lets a mail app (Thunderbird, Apple Mail, a
  phone) read it, sends mail, and provides secure login (OpenID Connect).
- **You reach it with:** `ssh root@mail.namel3ss.com` using your SSH key
  (password login is disabled on purpose).
- **Everything runs as containers** in `/opt/alo/deploy/production`. Run the
  `docker compose …` commands from inside that directory.

> Golden rule: you almost never need to touch this. It backs itself up,
> patches itself, renews its own certificate, and emails you if something is
> wrong. This runbook is for the rare day something needs a human.

## 1. Is everything healthy?

```sh
cd /opt/alo/deploy/production
docker compose ps
```

Every row should say **running** and the mail services should say
**(healthy)**. That's the whole health check.

To watch what a service is doing (no secrets are ever logged):

```sh
docker compose logs -f alo-smtp     # or alo-imap, alo-jmap, caddy
```

The server also checks itself every 10 minutes and **emails you** if anything
is wrong, so a quiet inbox means a healthy server.

---

## 2. The alert emails — what each one means

Alerts arrive from the server itself (subject starts with `[alo]`). You get
one when a problem appears, a reminder at most every 6 hours while it lasts,
and a "recovered" note when it clears.

| Alert says | Plain meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `service '…' is not running` | A part of the stack stopped. | `docker compose up -d` to bring it back; then `docker compose logs <service>` to see why. |
| `root disk is NN% full` | The disk is filling up. | See §7 (disk). Usually old logs or backups. |
| `TLS certificate expires in N days` | The HTTPS/mail certificate is close to expiry and didn't auto-renew. | See §5 (certificate). |
| `latest backup is Nh old` | The nightly backup didn't run. | `systemctl start alo-backup.service`, then check `journalctl -u alo-backup.service`. |
| `NN failed logins in the last …` | Someone is guessing passwords. | Usually harmless (attempts are rate-limited and IPs get banned). If it's you locked out, wait a few minutes. |
| `BACKUP FAILED` | The backup job errored out. | `journalctl -u alo-backup.service -n50` to see the error. |

Prove alerting still works at any time (sends you a harmless test email):

```sh
python3 /opt/alo/monitoring/monitor.py --test
```

---

## 3. Add a mailbox or an alias

**A whole new mailbox** (its own login and inbox):

```sh
cd /opt/alo/deploy/production
docker compose exec -e ALO_ADMIN_PASSWORD='a-strong-password' \
  alo-jmap identityctl bootstrap-admin your-org newuser@namel3ss.com
```

**An alias** (a second address that drops into an existing mailbox — e.g.
`dmarc@` or `sales@` landing in your inbox). Find the tenant and user id, then
add the alias:

```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U alo -d alo -c \
  "SELECT id AS user_id, tenant_id, email FROM users;"

# then (replace the address and the two ids):
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U alo -d alo <<'SQL'
INSERT INTO aliases (address, tenant_id, user_id)
VALUES ('sales@namel3ss.com', '<tenant_id>', '<user_id>')
ON CONFLICT (address) DO NOTHING;
SQL
```

Mail to the alias is delivered to that user's inbox. (A friendlier
`identityctl add-alias` command is a future improvement; today it's this
one-line insert.)

---

## 3a. Turn on AI (optional, per tenant)

AI features (the compose **Improve** action; more later) are **off by
default** and **bring-your-own-backend** (ADR 0011): you point a tenant at any
**OpenAI-compatible** endpoint. The simplest sovereign option is a local
**Ollama** on the same host — no key, nothing leaves your server:

```sh
# on the host, once: run Ollama and pull a small model
#   (any OpenAI-compatible server works — vLLM, or a hosted provider with a key)
ollama serve &                 # listens on http://localhost:11434
ollama pull llama3.2

cd /opt/alo/deploy/production
# Point the tenant at it and enable. Find the tenant id with:
#   docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U alo -d alo -c "SELECT id, name FROM tenants;"
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U alo -d alo <<'SQL'
INSERT INTO ai_config (tenant_id, base_url, model, api_key, enabled)
VALUES ('<tenant_id>', 'http://host.docker.internal:11434', 'llama3.2', NULL, TRUE)
ON CONFLICT (tenant_id) DO UPDATE
  SET base_url = EXCLUDED.base_url, model = EXCLUDED.model,
      api_key = EXCLUDED.api_key, enabled = EXCLUDED.enabled, updated_at = now();
SQL
docker compose restart alo-jmap    # picks up the new config
```

For a hosted provider instead, set `base_url` to its API root (e.g.
`https://api.mistral.ai`), `model` to one it serves, and `api_key` to your key.
To turn AI **off** for a tenant: `UPDATE ai_config SET enabled = FALSE WHERE
tenant_id = '<tenant_id>';`. The endpoint is **operator-set on purpose** — it is
never a user-editable field, so it cannot be pointed at internal services.
`api_key` is a secret: it is never returned to clients or written to logs.

## 4. Restore from backup

Backups are **encrypted** with restic and run nightly at 03:30. They contain
the database, all message bodies, the TLS certificate, and the config/DKIM
key. **The restic password is required to read them** — it is stored at
`/root/.config/alo/restic-password` on the server *and* you were told to
keep a copy somewhere off the server. Without it, backups cannot be decrypted
(by you or anyone else — that's the point).

**See what backups exist:**

```sh
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/opt/alo/backups/restic
export RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE=/root/.config/alo/restic-password
restic snapshots --tag alo
```

**Restore the database** (e.g. after data loss). This replaces the live
database — be sure:

```sh
cd /opt/alo/deploy/production
# 1. pull the newest DB dump out of the backup into /tmp/restore
restic restore latest --tag alo --include '*/alo-db.dump' --target /tmp/restore
# 2. load it back in
DUMP=$(find /tmp/restore -name alo-db.dump)
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore -U alo -d alo --clean --if-exists < "$DUMP"
```

**Restore message bodies / certs** (files): `restic restore latest --target /tmp/restore`
puts everything back under `/tmp/restore`; copy what you need into the matching
Docker volume mount-point (`docker volume inspect alo_blobs -f '{{.Mountpoint}}'`).

> This exact restore path has been tested end-to-end into a scratch database —
> the data (users, messages, mailboxes, blobs, certs, DKIM key) came back
> intact. Re-test it after any big change; a backup you've never restored is a
> hope, not a backup.

**Off-server copy:** not yet enabled (needs an external storage account). Once
it is, `backup.sh` gets a `restic copy` step to a second repository, and
you'll restore with the same commands pointed at that repository. Until then,
a total loss of this one server would lose the backups with it — this is the
top open item.

---

## 5. The TLS certificate

Let's Encrypt certificates cover HTTPS (443) and mail TLS (465/587/993/995).
They **renew themselves** (the `certbot` container checks twice a day and
renews within 30 days of expiry) and, since 2026-08-25, **are put into service
automatically** by `alo-cert-reload.timer`, which runs hourly.

**Renewing and serving are two different things.** certbot has no access to the
Docker socket — that socket is root on the host — so it cannot restart the
services that read the certificate; its only renewal hook fixes file
permissions. Before this timer existed, a renewed certificate sat on disk while
every service went on presenting the old one, and the deployment would have
stopped all at once on expiry day. It looked healthy only because deploys
happened to restart things often enough.

`cert-reload.sh` restarts a service when the certificate is newer than the
process reading it — the certificate's mtime against each container's start
time — so it is correct on its first run and does nothing when there is nothing
to do.

**Caddy must be restarted, not reloaded.** `caddy reload` re-reads the Caddyfile,
not the certificate files it already holds in memory. On 2026-08-25 a reissued
certificate reached 993 and 465 while 443 kept serving the old one until Caddy
was restarted outright. By hand, if ever needed:

```sh
cd /opt/alo/deploy/production
docker compose restart caddy alo-smtp alo-imap
```

To check what is actually **served**, rather than what is on disk:

```sh
for p in 443 993 465; do
  echo | openssl s_client -connect mail.alomails.com:$p -servername mail.alomails.com 2>/dev/null \
    | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
done
```

If the "certificate expires soon" alert fires, read
`journalctl -u alo-cert-reload.service -n50` first, then run
`docker exec alo-certbot-1 certbot renew --dry-run`. It reports each
certificate separately — one can fail while the rest succeed, which is how
`mail.alomails.com` was found to be renewing by the wrong method (`standalone`,
which cannot bind port 80 because Caddy owns it, instead of `webroot`).

---

## 6. Security posture (what's already protecting you)

- **Firewall (ufw):** only the ports mail needs are open — 22 (SSH), 25, 80,
  443, 465, 587, 993, 995. Cleartext-capable IMAP **143 is closed**.
- **SSH:** key-only, password login disabled.
- **fail2ban:** automatically bans IPs that repeatedly fail SSH.
- **Automatic security updates:** the OS installs security patches on its own
  and reboots at 04:30 if a patch needs it.
- **Not an open relay:** the server refuses to forward mail for strangers
  (tested). Sending requires a real login.
- **Inbound DMARC enforced:** forged mail from domains that publish a reject
  policy (e.g. a fake "google.com") is refused.
- **Login rate-limiting:** repeated bad logins to mail are slowed with
  per-account backoff and per-connection caps.
- **Logs are capped** at 50 MB per service (rotated) so they can't fill the
  disk, while keeping a generous window of security events.

Check the firewall or the ban list anytime:

```sh
ufw status verbose
fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

## 7. Disk, and turning things off

**Disk usage:**

```sh
df -h /
docker system df          # how much Docker is using
```

If it's ever tight: old backups already self-prune (7 daily + 4 weekly kept);
container logs are capped. `docker system prune` removes unused images.

**Kill-switch for outbound sending** (stop the server sending mail, keep
receiving/reading):

```sh
# in .env set ALO_SMTP_OUTBOUND_ENABLED=false, then:
docker compose up -d alo-smtp
```

**Stop / start everything:**

```sh
docker compose stop        # stop (data kept)
docker compose up -d       # start again
# NEVER: docker compose down -v   ← the -v deletes all data irreversibly
```

---

## 8. DNS records (what's set, what's still to add)

Current, working records for `namel3ss.com`:

| Record | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MX → mail.namel3ss.com` | where the world sends your mail |
| `A mail.namel3ss.com → 152.53.179.142` | the server |
| `PTR (reverse DNS) → mail.namel3ss.com` | sender reputation |
| `TXT` SPF `v=spf1 mx -all` | only this server may send as you |
| `TXT fic._domainkey` (Ed25519 DKIM) | signs your outgoing mail |
| `TXT _dmarc` `p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@namel3ss.com` | anti-forgery + reports (now land in your inbox) |

**Still to add** for full deliverability hardening (needs your DNS provider;
none of these cost anything). After you add the first one, ask to have the
certificate re-issued to include `mta-sts.namel3ss.com` and the policy turned on:

| Record | Value |
|---|---|
| `A mta-sts.namel3ss.com` | `152.53.179.142` |
| `TXT _mta-sts.namel3ss.com` | `v=STSv1; id=20260729000000` |
| `TXT _smtp._tls.namel3ss.com` | `v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:dmarc@namel3ss.com` |

MTA-STS tells other mail servers to always use encryption when sending to you
(and never silently fall back to cleartext); TLS-RPT emails you a report if any
of them can't.

## 9. Open items (need an account or your action)

1. **Off-server backup copy** — pick EU object storage (Scaleway free tier
   recommended), then the nightly backup gets copied off-box. Until done, the
   backups live only on the server. *(§4 above.)*
2. **External uptime check** — a monitor outside this server so you're alerted
   even if the whole box goes down. Needs a small external account
   (e.g. a free uptime service).
3. **MTA-STS / TLS-RPT DNS** — the three records in §8.
4. **Re-run mail-tester** — after the DNS items, send a message to a fresh
   `mail-tester.com` address to confirm the score. Last score: 8/10, with
   SPF, DKIM and DMARC all passing.
