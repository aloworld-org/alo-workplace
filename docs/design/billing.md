# Design note — alo Billing (customers, products, quotes, invoices, payments)

Status: **as built** · 2026-08-07 · ADR 0035 · Business track wave B1

alo Billing is the first Work OS module: the quote → invoice → payment
arc for EU SMEs, with legal sequential numbering and EN 16931
e-invoicing as the wedge. It is built from scratch on the tenant-scoped
store, money is integer cents everywhere, and every total is computed
server-side. This note records the surface, data model, error map,
tenancy, and the numbering decision before the first migration lands.
It was written ahead of the first migration and brought to as-built at
the B1 wave review (B1.27); every section marked *as built* describes
code that exists. What B1 promised and what B1 shipped are reconciled
line by line at the end of this note.

## Surface

- **Inputs:** authenticated workspace users driving `/billing/*` routes
  on `alo-jmap` — customer and product CRUD, quote and invoice draft
  CRUD, the issue and credit-note actions, payment recording, the VAT
  report, and the PDF/e-invoice renderings. The billing agent
  (ADR 0034, item B1.25) is a second caller of the same store
  functions, never of a parallel code path.
- **Outputs:** JSON resources with server-computed totals; a printable
  HTML document and its PDF rendering; Factur-X (CII) and XRechnung
  (UBL 2.1) XML for issued invoices; CSV for the VAT summary; and mail
  **drafts** (never sends) when an invoice or reminder goes to a
  customer.
- **Who calls it:** `web/src/billing` (the module UI, B1.13–B1.16)
  calls `alo-jmap`; the `alo-ai` billing module produces
  propose-then-approve envelopes that `alo-jmap` executes; nothing
  external calls billing directly in B1 (Peppol is a later item and
  goes through a certified access point, not our own endpoint).

### Web surface — as-built (B1.13)

`web/src/billing` is a rail module of the **workspace product only**
(`product/workplace.tsx`), mounted at `/billing/*` with a tab per record
type: `customers` and `products`, and `/billing` redirecting to the
first. Later items add tabs (invoices, quotes), never a second
navigation idea.

Three rules the module holds itself to, so the screens can never become
a second, weaker definition of billing:

- **No validation in the client.** A form sends what was typed; a `422`
  is shown in the server's own words next to the form, which stays open
  and keeps everything the user entered. The only client-side refusal is
  text that is not a number at all (`money.ts`), because turning typing
  into integer cents is inherently the client's job.
- **No money is computed in the browser.** `money.ts` parses one typed
  decimal into hundredths (cents, or basis points for a rate) and
  formats one back; every total comes from the API.
- **An edit sends only the fields that changed.** The surface is
  last-writer-wins (no `ETag` yet), so a field nobody touched is not
  written. A cleared text box sends `null`, which is how a VAT id comes
  off a customer.

`web/src/billing/api.ts` is a small client of its own rather than more
methods on `JmapClient`: billing is plain REST, with none of JMAP's
session or method-call envelope, and it changes for different reasons.
It shares the auth layer's `authorizedFetch`, so there is one session.

The tabs as built are `invoices` (also what `/billing` lands on),
`quotes`, `customers`, `products`.

### Documents on screen — as-built (B1.14, B1.15)

An invoice and a quote are the same document with different words on
it, so they are **one screen**, not two that look alike:
`documentDraft.ts` holds the form and the autosave loop,
`DocumentEditor.tsx` renders it, `DocumentLines.tsx` is the line grid,
and `InvoiceEditor` / `QuoteEditor` supply only what differs — the
words, the two dates, the state chips, and the transitions.

Three rules on top of the module's own:

- **A transition acts on the stored document, so it waits for the
  form.** While the draft holds edits the server has not stored, every
  lifecycle button is disabled and says why. Firing one then would
  freeze a document that is not the one on screen, and the keystrokes
  since the last save would be lost inside a document nobody can edit
  again. A row that cannot become a line keeps this true indefinitely,
  which is correct.
- **Every transition asks first, and the dialog states what it does to
  the document** — spends the next number of the series and freezes it,
  closes the offer for good — rather than asking whether the user is
  sure. Each is irreversible on a legal document.
- **A transition request carries no body.** What a document becomes is
  the route, never a field a stale form could have sent.

Where a transition answers with a *different* document — accepting a
quote, raising a credit note — the screen goes to that document, because
it is the one that now needs work. Both directions of each link are on
the record: an invoice names the quote it came from and the invoice it
credits; a quote names the invoice it became.

### The printed document — the decision (B1.16)

**Chosen: the printable document is rendered on the server**, by
`alo-jmap`, as one self-contained HTML page (`billing_print.rs`) —
inline CSS, no script, no external asset of any kind.

**Rejected: rendering it in the browser from the React module.** Three
things make the client the wrong place for it:

- **It is the PDF source** (B1.17). Whatever produces the PDF —
  headless chromium or a Rust HTML-to-PDF path — runs *without a
  browser session*, so a client-rendered document would have to be
  reimplemented server-side, and the paper the customer holds would
  come from a second, drifting definition of the same document.
- **It is also the mail attachment** (B1.18), produced when nobody is
  looking at a screen at all.
- **It must be printable from a page we do not style.** A document
  assembled from the app's `ds` tokens inherits the app's layout; a
  standalone page with its own `@page` rules is what actually yields
  an A4 sheet.

The browser therefore *fetches* the document rather than composing it:
`GET /billing/{invoices,quotes}/{id}/print` with the session's bearer
token, the returned HTML into a hidden `srcdoc` iframe, `print()`. A
plain link would open an unauthenticated tab, and printing a document
is not a reason to invent a second way in.

Rules the renderer holds itself to:

- **Every value is escaped, and the page can reach nothing.** Customer
  data goes through one escaper, so a defect there is the only way
  markup could appear at all — and two *different* mechanisms stop it
  becoming a request, one per place the page is used. Fetched as a
  document (headless chromium at B1.17, a saved file, a mail client)
  the response's own `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`
  binds it. Mounted by the web app it is copied into a **same-origin
  `srcdoc` frame**, which inherits the *app's* policy and never sees
  that header — so the frame is **sandboxed without `allow-scripts`**.
  Neither mechanism substitutes for the other, and the code says so in
  both places.
- **The document says what it is.** A draft prints as a draft and
  carries no number (it has none); a void invoice prints as void; a
  credit note is titled as one. A printed page that could be mistaken
  for an issued invoice is a legal problem, not a cosmetic one.
- **No money is computed here either.** The renderer prints the store's
  cents; it only groups digits.
- **Its words are a table, not literals in the markup**
  (`billing_print::Strings`), keyed by document language — the same
  externalisation rule as the web catalogues, in the one place a
  customer-facing string is emitted by Rust. **en, fr and nl all ship
  (B1.27)**; an unknown language falls back to the default rather than
  refusing: a filter may be strict, but a document that will not print
  because of a display preference is worse than a document printed in
  English. Matching is on the primary subtag, so `fr-BE` prints in
  French. The **separators are part of the table**, not a constant:
  Dutch groups thousands with the character English reads as a decimal
  point, and a document that borrowed another language's separators
  would print an amount a thousandfold wrong to the person holding it.

**The issuer's own details** — who is billing, their VAT and
registration numbers, and the bank the money goes to — are a *tenant*
record, not a per-document one, so B1.16 also lands `billing_settings`
(below). The logo is a **monogram placeholder** drawn from the legal
name: a real logo is a Drive file and an upload surface, which is its
own item, and a blank rectangle on every invoice is worse than initials.

As-built (B1.16), the decisions the page itself forced:

- **Dates print as ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` in every language.** `05/03/2026`
  is two different days depending on who reads it, and a due date a
  customer can misread by two months is a dispute. EN 16931 dates are
  ISO for the same reason.
- **Amounts are grouped and carry the ISO currency code**
  (`EUR 1 843.60`), never a symbol: the code is what the e-invoice
  schemas want and is unambiguous across member states.
- **The number is stated once.** It is in the heading, so the grid
  beside it does not repeat it — a document that states its own number
  twice makes a reader check whether the two agree.
- **A domestic address does not print its country.** Postal convention
  names the country only when the document crosses a border, and a lone
  `NL` under a Dutch address reads like a stray field. Cross-border it
  is the line that decides the VAT treatment, so it stays. **The code
  stays a code (B1.27).** Printing `Deutschland` / `Allemagne` /
  `Duitsland` would need 27 country names in each shipped language, and
  the one place the country is legally load-bearing — BT-40 and BT-55 of
  EN 16931 — is a code anyway; `DE` under an address is read the same
  way in every member state.
- **A quote and a credit note print no bank details.** Both say
  explicitly that nothing is payable; an IBAN under that sentence is
  how a document gets paid twice. An invoice with no due date yet (a
  draft) states the term instead, so the page never simply omits when
  the money is owed.
- **The issuer is read live, not snapshotted at issue.** Reprinting last
  year's invoice shows the current address and bank, which is what
  moving office or changing bank is supposed to do; the facts that must
  never drift — number, dates, lines, money — are on the document.
- **`?lang=` falls back rather than refusing**, unlike the `status`
  filter: a filter that silently widened would mislead a bookkeeper, but
  a document that will not print because of a display preference is
  worse than one printed in English.

### The PDF — the decision (B1.17)

The queue offered two paths: render the B1.16 HTML page with **headless
chromium in a build-time-pinned container**, or take a **pure-Rust**
path. Both were considered against the same document.

**Rejected: headless chromium.** Not because it renders badly — it
renders our own page, so it renders perfectly — but because of what it
costs to own:

- It is a **new engine in the deployment**. Our engines (Synapse,
  LiveKit, Collabora, Garage) are pinned upstream containers behind our
  APIs, and adding one is an architecture decision with an ADR, a
  ~1 GB image, and a browser process on the invoice path. A tenant who
  self-hosts alo would have to run a browser to print a bill.
- It puts a **second, unpinned layout engine** between the document and
  the paper: the PDF a customer receives would depend on the chromium
  build that happened to be in the image.
- It is **operationally fragile in exactly the wrong place**: an invoice
  that will not render is an invoice that cannot be sent, and the
  failure modes (sandbox, fonts, zombie processes, memory) are a browser's,
  not ours.

**Chosen: a pure-Rust writer — and, precisely, *not* an HTML-to-PDF
path.** We do not parse our own HTML back. The PDF and the HTML page are
**two renderers over one model**: both are handed the same
`billing_print::PrintDocument` (the same store figures, the same
`Strings` table, the same `amount`/`quantity`/`rate`/`date` formatters),
and neither can invent a value the other does not have. A general
HTML-to-CSS-layout engine in Rust would be a project of its own; laying
out a document whose shape we already know is a page of arithmetic.

The writer is `platform/alo-pdf` — a **minimal PDF 1.7 producer**
(objects, xref, pages, content streams, the standard-14 fonts) with no
dependencies, in `platform/` because a PDF file is not a billing
concept: Drive exports and Docs will want the same writer. The layout
lives with the document that has the shape, in
`alo-jmap/src/billing_pdf.rs`.

The cost of the choice, stated plainly:

- **Text is limited to the WinAnsi (cp1252) repertoire**, because the
  standard-14 fonts are the only fonts we have without shipping a font
  file. That covers Western Europe exactly and **misses Polish, Czech,
  Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian, Baltic, Greek and Cyrillic letters**.
  Rather than print `?ukasz`, the encoder folds Latin letters to their
  base form (`Łukasz` → `Lukasz`, `Škoda` stays `Škoda` — that one *is*
  in cp1252); a non-Latin script is the last resort, `?`.
- **This is a stopgap with a deadline, not a position.** PDF/A-3 (B1.22,
  Factur-X) *requires* every font to be embedded, so the font file lands
  there and this fold disappears with it. **Which** font — brand,
  licence, repository weight — is a human decision, recorded in
  `docs/autonomy/STATE.md`, not one the build loop makes by downloading
  a binary into a public repository.
- The character-width tables are **read from a real Helvetica, not
  remembered**: `platform/alo-pdf/src/metrics.rs` records how they were
  extracted, and a test pins the values a misaligned money column would
  betray.

### Routes

All under the authenticated `alo-jmap` router, following the existing
action-route convention (typed `Problem` errors, `authenticate`
extractor, registered in `server.rs`):

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET/POST /billing/customers`, `GET/PATCH/POST /billing/customers/{id}[/archive]` | customer CRUD (B1.05) |
| `GET/POST /billing/products`, `GET/PATCH/POST /billing/products/{id}[/archive]` | price-list CRUD (B1.05) |
| `GET/POST /billing/invoices`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /billing/invoices/{id}` | draft CRUD + list with status filter (B1.10); `DELETE` is draft-only, an issued document is voided instead |
| `POST /billing/invoices/{id}/issue` | assign number, freeze (B1.10) |
| `POST /billing/invoices/{id}/void` | cancel an issued document, keeping its number (B1.10) |
| `POST /billing/invoices/{id}/credit-note` | create the crediting invoice (B1.10) |
| `GET /billing/settings`, `PATCH /billing/settings` | the issuer's own identity, bank details and accounting currency (B1.16, B1.21) — **as built** |
| `GET /billing/fx/rates`, `PUT /billing/fx/rates`, `POST /billing/fx/rates/import` | the exchange rates a tenant's foreign-currency documents are converted at (B1.21) — **as built** |
| `GET /billing/invoices/{id}/print[?lang=]`, `GET /billing/quotes/{id}/print[?lang=]` | the printable document as one self-contained HTML page (B1.16) — **as built** |
| `GET /billing/quotes/{id}/pdf[?lang=]` | the offer as a PDF file, its designed content set on the sheet — **as built** |
| `GET /billing/quotes/{id}/design`, `PUT /billing/quotes/{id}/design` | the quotation studio's design of the offer — blocks, colours, column choices — kept with the quote and rendered by `/print` and `/pdf`; `PUT` on a sent offer is `409` — **as built** |

As-built (B1.10), for the invoice routes specifically:

- **The header and the line set travel in one body.** `lines` is an ordinary
  field of the invoice body on both `POST` and `PATCH`, replacing the whole set
  in the order sent; absent, it leaves the stored lines alone. A draft editor
  saves the document it is looking at, not a patch stream. A body that states
  only `lines` deliberately does **not** touch the header — replaying the stored
  header would re-resolve the customer, and a draft whose customer was archived
  afterwards could then never have its lines edited again.
- **Money is only ever read.** Every response carries server-computed `totals`
  (net, gross, and the VAT breakdown per rate) and a per-line `netCents`; there
  is no writable total anywhere in the surface. There is no per-line VAT field,
  because VAT is rounded once per rate subtotal and a per-line column would not
  add up to the document's own.
- **`overdue` is derived on read** (`Invoice::is_overdue`) from the status and
  the frozen due date, never stored — a stored flag would be wrong every
  midnight — and judged against the server's date, never one a client sends.
- **The `status` filter is strict** (`422` on an unrecognised value), unlike the
  forgiving boolean query flags: a filter that silently widened to "everything"
  would show a bookkeeper drafts among their issued documents.
- **`GET /billing/invoices/{id}` also answers `creditNotes`** — the summaries of
  what credits this document, drafts included: the ledger of a corrected
  invoice, and the read the issued view needs.
- **Lifecycle transitions are their own `POST`s**, never fields on the `PATCH`,
  so issuing (which assigns a legal number and freezes the document) can never
  happen because an editor submitted a stale form.
- **`status`, `number`, `issueDate` and `dueDate` are not writable** by any
  request; like any unknown field they are ignored.

The rest of the surface, with the wave item that landed each:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /billing/invoices/{id}/pdf`, `.../facturx.xml`, `.../xrechnung.xml` | the three renderings (B1.17, B1.22, B1.23) — **as built** |
| `POST /billing/invoices/{id}/send` | draft an email with the PDF attached (B1.18) — **as built** |
| `POST /billing/invoices/{id}/reminder` | draft a payment reminder for a late invoice (B1.26) — **as built** |
| `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /billing/quotes[/{id}]`, `POST .../{send,accept,decline,expire}` | quote lifecycle, and accept → draft invoice (B1.11, B1.12) — **as built** |
| `POST /billing/bills/import`, `GET /billing/bills[/{id}][?status=|?payable=true]`, `POST .../{approve,reject}`, `DELETE .../{id}` | receiving a supplier's e-invoice (B1.24), and what is waiting to be paid (B2.12) — **as built** |
| `POST /billing/bills/sepa.xml` | the approved bills of a run as one SEPA `pain.001` credit-transfer file, and the record that the instruction was given (B2.12) — **as built** |
| `GET/POST /billing/schedules`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /billing/schedules/{id}`, `POST .../{pause,resume}`, `POST /billing/schedules/run` | recurring invoices: the standing arrangements and the run that raises the drafts they are due for (B2.11) — **as built** |

### Receiving an e-invoice (as built, B1.24)

The mirror of the two renderers: a supplier sends their Factur-X (CII) or
XRechnung (UBL) file, and it becomes a **bill** — their document, waiting for
us to approve or reject it.

| Module | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `alo-store/billing_xml_tree.rs` | a bounded, defensive XML tree: no DTD (so no entity expansion), capped depth/elements/text, local names only |
| `alo-store/billing_einvoice_import.rs` | the semantic model inbound, the exact-integer readers (cents, milli-units, basis points), and the consistency rules a document must satisfy |
| `alo-store/billing_cii_read.rs`, `billing_ubl_read.rs` | where each syntax writes things down, and nothing else |
| `alo-store/billing_bills.rs` | the `billing_bills` table, the duplicate rule, and the approval door |
| `alo-jmap/billing_bills.rs` | the six routes |

**The reader lives in the store, while the writers live in `alo-jmap`.** The
writers render from a `PrintDocument`, which belongs to the HTTP crate; the
reader depends on nothing but the tree it walks, and a supplier's invoice
mostly arrives **by email** — the path that will one day book an attachment is
the delivery pipeline, which must not depend on the HTTP crate to do it.

Five decisions, each one a refusal rather than a guess:

- **What is stored is what the document says.** The totals (BT-106 … BT-115)
  are copied across, not recomputed: the supplier's paper is the authority on
  what they are charging. Every response nevertheless carries **both** — their
  `totals` and our `computed` figures over the stored lines — because the
  import refuses a document where the two disagree.
- **An incoherent document is refused at the door**, with the rule named:
  a line whose stated amount is not quantity × price (`BT-131` — which is what
  a line-level allowance, a charge, or a price base quantity looks like from
  here), the standard's total equations (`BR-CO-10/13/15/16`), and the VAT
  following from the lines at the rates stated (`BR-CO-14/17`). A rounding
  amount (`BT-114`) is refused too: a few cents belonging to no line and no
  rate cannot be stored, and paying a different figure from the one asked for
  is worse than not importing.
- **A VAT category we cannot express is refused, not flattened.** Our lines
  carry a rate, not a category, so `AE` reverse charge, `K` intra-community
  supply, `G` export and `E` exemption all look like 0 %. Storing one as
  zero-rated would understate a return and hide that the **buyer** owes the tax.
  (The outbound side has the same gap, recorded at B1.22.)
- **A credit note is stored in ledger direction** — negative — exactly as our
  own are (B1.09). The file states type 381 with positive amounts; the sign is
  flipped once, after every check has run on the figures as stated.
- **The same document is never booked twice.** `(supplier, number)` is the
  document's identity — a supplier's number is unique within that supplier by
  law — so the same invoice forwarded twice and imported by two people is one
  bill and a `409`. The supplier key is their VAT id, or their name folded to
  lower case when they state none. The SHA-256 of the imported bytes is stored
  as well, but is **not** the identity: a re-export of the same document differs
  byte for byte and is still the same document.

**A decision is final** (`received → approved | rejected`, `409` on a second):
an approved bill is a liability the accounts carry, and un-approving it would
rewrite history — a bill accepted by mistake is corrected by the supplier's
credit note, which arrives as a bill of its own. **Deletion is undecided-only**:
the undo for the wrong file, not a way out of the record.

**Not there yet:** reading the XML embedded in a hybrid PDF. A PDF upload is
recognised by its magic bytes and answered with a `422` that says to upload the
XML attachment instead. The original file is not archived either — that is a
Drive concern; the stored checksum is what will tie a bill to that archive.

### The e-invoice (as built, B1.22 + B1.23)

An invoice that a machine reads is a different document from the one a person
reads, and EN 16931 is the European law about the first. Six modules, split
along the standard's own seams — the model, its rules, and each syntax:

| Module | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `billing_einvoice.rs` | the **semantic** invoice: the standard's business terms (BT-1, BT-112, …) built from the same `PrintDocument` the paper and the PDF are built from |
| `billing_einvoice_rules.rs` | the **business rules** over those terms, cited by identifier (`BR-09`, `BR-CO-15`, `BR-S-09`) |
| `billing_cii.rs` | one **syntax**: UN/CEFACT CII, which is what Factur-X carries |
| `billing_ubl.rs` | the other **syntax**: OASIS UBL 2.1, which is what XRechnung carries (B1.23) |
| `billing_xrechnung_rules.rs` | the **German narrowing** of those rules (`BR-DE-*`), additional to the European ones, never instead of them (B1.23) |
| `billing_xml.rs` | what the two syntaxes agree on: the emitter, the number formats, the escaper, the file response |

The seam matters because the two syntaxes in law are the *same invoice twice*;
mapping our records straight into two dialects of XML would put the decisions
below in two places that would drift.

**The decisions:**

- **A credit note is issued in credit direction, not in negatives.** Our store
  mirrors an invoice by negating quantities, so a stored credit note has
  negative amounts. EN 16931 carries the direction in the type code — 381 *is*
  "money goes back" — and receiving systems overwhelmingly expect a 381 whose
  amounts are positive. Every quantity and amount is multiplied by −1 for a
  credit note (not made absolute, so a partial credit keeps its structure).
  **Flagged for human review**: the standard does not forbid the other reading.
- **The e-invoice states the document, not its settlement.** Payments recorded
  against the invoice (B1.19) are deliberately not BT-113, so BT-115 amount due
  equals BT-112 total with VAT — the same figure the paper carries.
- **Only categories `S` and `Z` are expressible**, because a line carries a
  *rate* and not a category. Reverse charge (`AE`), intra-community supply
  (`K`), export (`G`) and exemption (`E`) all print 0 % and mean different
  things, and each needs an exemption reason. **A per-line VAT category is a
  data-model addition a human has to schedule**; guessing `Z` for an
  intra-community supply would understate somebody's return.
- **Validation is a refusal, not a warning.** `GET .../facturx.xml` runs the
  rules before it renders: a draft and a void document are `409` (a draft has
  no number; a cancelled e-invoice does not exist — correct it with a credit
  note), and a document that breaks a rule is `422` **naming the rules**. A
  tenant learns that its country is unstated from us, not from a customer's
  gateway a fortnight later.
- **The PDF never fails because of it.** `GET .../pdf` embeds the e-invoice
  when there is a valid one and prints an ordinary PDF when there is not. A
  document must always print.
- **Not the official schematron.** The normative artefacts are XSLT, and an
  XSLT processor is a third language (`CLAUDE.md`) plus a downloaded binary in
  a public repository. What ships is a hand-written subset of the rules our
  model can break, cited by identifier, run on the route *and* over four golden
  documents in `alo-jmap/tests/golden/`. Running the normative schematron in CI
  is an open item for a human, recorded in `docs/autonomy/STATE.md`.

**Two syntaxes, one model (B1.23).** `GET .../xrechnung.xml` serves the same
semantic invoice as OASIS UBL 2.1 in the German CIUS — the file a public
authority in Germany must be invoiced with, and what a Peppol access point
moves. It is a *renderer*, not a second invoice: nothing about the document is
decided in `billing_ubl.rs` that is not already decided in
`billing_einvoice.rs`, and the golden sets for the two syntaxes pin the same
four documents so a figure that moves in one and not the other is a failing
test. Three things are genuinely different, and they are in the syntax, not the
invoice:

- **A credit note is a different root schema** (`ubl:CreditNote`), with
  `cac:CreditNoteLine` and `cbc:CreditedQuantity`. CII changes a code; UBL
  changes the document.
- **Every amount states its currency**, where in CII stating it twice is a
  validation error.
- **XRechnung requires terms EN 16931 leaves optional**, so the same invoice can
  be a valid Factur-X and an invalid XRechnung. The seller needs a contact desk
  with a **telephone number** (`BR-DE-7`) and email, both parties need a full
  postal address, and the document needs a **buyer reference** (`BR-DE-15`) —
  the *Leitweg-ID* a German authority is addressed by. The route reports both
  rule sets in one `422`, so a tenant fixes its details once.

Two consequences a reader should expect. The seller's details are read **live**,
so filling in the telephone number fixes every document at once; the buyer
reference belongs to the **frozen** document, so an issued invoice raised
without one cannot be edited into compliance — it is credited and reissued. And
a credit note (and an invoice from a tenant with no bank account) states payment
means code `1`, *instrument not defined*: `BR-DE-1` wants the group on every
document, and naming the seller's own account on a credit note would invite a
customer to pay a document that owes them.

**The carrier is not yet PDF/A-3.** `alo-pdf` grew everything else the hybrid
needs — the attachment, `/AFRelationship /Alternative`, the `/AF` array, the
embedded-files name tree and an XMP packet — and the XMP describes *the
attached XML* without claiming a `pdfaid` conformance level the file does not
have. The two remaining requirements are an embedded font and an output-intent

### Payments (as built, B1.19)

The routes hang **under the invoice**, not at a flat `/billing/payments`:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /billing/invoices/{id}/payments` | the ledger of one document, and what it adds up to |
| `POST /billing/invoices/{id}/payments` | record money received; answers the payment **and** the document it changed |
| `DELETE /billing/invoices/{id}/payments/{paymentId}` | remove one recorded wrongly |

**Rejected: the flat `GET/POST /billing/payments` this note originally
planned.** A payment does not exist on its own — it settles one document — and
addressing it through that document is what makes an id belonging to another
invoice (or another tenant) a plain `404` rather than a write landing somewhere
unexpected. The flat shape would have needed an `invoiceId` in the body, which
is a second place a request could name a document.

Four decisions the rest of the wave inherits:

- **The paid-state is derived, never written.** `billing_invoices.status` moves
  to `paid` (and back to `issued`) only as a **projection** the store recomputes
  inside the transaction that inserts or removes a payment, under the invoice's
  row lock. No request can set it, and it cannot drift from the rows beneath it.
- **"Partially paid" is not a status.** It is a fact about money — the sum of
  the payments against the computed gross — reported as `settlement` on every
  invoice response (`grossCents`, `paidCents`, `outstandingCents`, `state` of
  `unpaid | partiallyPaid | paid`). A half-paid document is still `issued`,
  still owed, and still overdue when its date passes.
- **Amounts are strictly positive**, so a typo is never indistinguishable from a
  refund: a payment recorded wrongly is removed and re-entered, and a debt that
  genuinely changed is a credit note. **Overpayment counts as settled**, with
  `outstandingCents` going negative — the figure a refund starts from.
- **Money only attaches to a document that is owed.** A draft, a void document
  and a **credit note** are all refused (`409`); a `paid` one still accepts more,
  which is how a duplicate transfer is recorded honestly rather than hidden.
  Conversely, an invoice with any payment against it can no longer be **voided**
  — that would leave received money attached to a document owing nothing — so it
  is corrected with a credit note instead.

The **overdue view** is `GET /billing/invoices?overdue=1`: issued, past its due
date, not settled, and **not a credit note** — money owed to the customer makes
nobody late. It is judged against the database's own date inside the same
statement, so no client clock can clear or invent a late invoice, and it shares
the predicate with the per-row `overdue` flag so the two can never disagree.

### The VAT summary of a period (as built, B1.20)

Two routes, one read:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /billing/reports/vat?from&to` | what was billed at each VAT rate between two days, both included |
| `GET /billing/reports/vat.csv?from&to` | the same figures as a file for the accountant |

Separate paths rather than one route with a `?format=`, exactly as `/print` and
`/pdf` are: a URL that names its representation is the one a browser saves under
a sensible name and a script quotes without a query string.

Five decisions, each the strict reading rather than the convenient one — this
is a figure a human is legally answerable for once they copy it onto a return:

- **The period is judged on the issue date**, the day frozen on the document
  when it was numbered — not the day it was keyed in, and not the day the money
  arrived. Under the ordinary invoice-based (accrual) scheme that is the tax
  point, and it is the only date on the document that cannot move afterwards. A
  **cash-accounting** variant would be a different report, over the payments;
  it is deliberately not this one and is not silently approximated by it.
  *Flagged for human review:* member states that operate a cash-accounting
  regime (and tenants opted into one) need that second report before they can
  file from alo — B4, with the ledger.
- **Only documents that stand are counted**: `issued` and `paid`. A `draft` was
  never raised; a `void` one was cancelled and keeps its number only so the
  series stays gapless. Neither charged anybody any tax.
- **Credit notes subtract, and are counted apart.** They already carry negated
  lines, so they subtract by construction; the separate count exists because a
  quiet quarter and a heavily corrected one are different facts.
- **Each document's own rounded VAT is summed**, never the rate re-applied to
  the summed net. The tax charged in a period is the tax on the documents the
  customers hold; recomputing it from the total would differ by cents from the
  paperwork, and a return that disagrees with its own invoices is the defect
  this rule exists to prevent.
- **Currency groups are never added together** — one group per currency, each
  self-contained — **and then the whole period is stated once in the tenant's
  accounting currency** (B1.21), which is the figure a return is actually filed
  from. Every document is converted at the rate frozen on *it*, never at
  today's rate, and a document whose snapshot cannot be applied is counted as
  **unconverted** rather than being assigned a rate nobody used: the surface says
  how many, because a tax total quietly missing a document is worse than none.

Both `from` and `to` are **required** (`422` otherwise, naming which end is
wrong): a report that defaulted to a period would put a figure under a heading
nobody asked for. A period that ends before it starts is the store's `422`.

The CSV is one table — a `rate` row per VAT rate in each currency, then that
currency's `total` row, with a `row` column saying which kind you are reading.
Its **column names are a contract, in English**, and its amounts are plain
decimals with a `.` separator and no grouping: it is read by scripts and by an
accountant's own tooling, so it does not move with the user's interface
language. It is served as an `attachment`, `nosniff`, `no-store`, like the PDF.
It carries **no customer data at all** — currencies, rates, amounts and counts,
and nothing that names anybody.

### Invoicing in another currency (as built, B1.21)

A document may be raised in any currency; the tenant's books are kept in one
(`billing_settings.base_currency`, defaulted to `EUR` — a tenant that has said
nothing still keeps books in something). What joins the two is a **rate frozen on
the document when it is issued**, and everything else here follows from that
choice.

**Why a snapshot and not a lookup.** EU VAT Directive art. 91 fixes the
conversion rate at the moment the tax becomes chargeable — the issue date, under
the invoice-based scheme this report already lives by — and art. 230 requires the
VAT payable to be expressed in the member state's own currency on the document
itself. Both are facts about the document, so both live on it, exactly like its
number and its dates. Re-deriving the rate at read time would restate last
year's invoice the moment a rate row was corrected.

**The rate is an integer, quoted the way the ECB quotes it**: micro-units of the
document's currency per one unit of the accounting currency (`1 EUR = 1.162600
USD` is `1162600`). Money never touches a float, and keeping the published
direction preserves the precision of the far currencies (the yen's six honest
decimals rather than its reciprocal's four). Crossing an amount is therefore a
division, rounded **half away from zero** — the one rounding convention
`billing_totals` already uses, so a credit note stays the exact mirror of its
original *after* conversion and a corrected period still sums to zero in the
books. A document is converted **per VAT-rate subtotal**, and its restated total
is the sum of those rows, because a return is filed per rate.

**The rate table is tenant-scoped**, although published rates are a public fact:
a tenant is audited against the file *it* imported, some member states prescribe
a different published series than the ECB's, and a shared table would let one
tenant's import restate another's books (law 1). The volume is about thirty rows
per working day.

**Nothing is ever fetched.** `POST /billing/fx/rates/import` parses a
reference-rate file the caller supplies (the ECB's `eurofxref` CSV — the daily,
90-day and full-history files share one layout), and `PUT /billing/fx/rates`
takes one rate by hand as the decimal it was published as. An import is **all or
nothing**: one bad cell changes nothing and answers a `422` naming the row and
the column, because half an imported day would convert the next document from
rates the tenant believes it imported in full. A data row with more values than
the header names currencies is refused too — that is what a rate written with a
`,` decimal separator looks like, and importing it as a whole number would
misstate every amount it touched.

**Which rate a document gets.** The last publication at or before the issue date
— art. 91(2)'s "last preceding date of publication", which is what makes a
Sunday invoice convert at Friday's rate — and **never** one more than seven days
old (the longest real gap in the series is four days: Easter, Christmas). A
document in the accounting currency takes the identity rate and needs no table at
all. An issuer that keeps books outside the euro gets the **cross** of two euro
quotes *from the same publication day*, computed once and snapshotted, so the
number on the document is the number that was applied.

**Issuing is refused when no rate is available** (`422`, naming the currency and
the day): without one the document cannot state its VAT in the member state's
currency, so it would be legally incomplete, and the draft is left unnumbered
rather than issued at a guessed rate.

**A credit note inherits its original's rate**, not the rate of the day it was
raised. The correction relates to the supply the original invoiced, and at one
rate the pair cancels exactly while at two it leaves a residue in the books that
nothing on either document explains. This is the strict reading flagged for human
review in `docs/autonomy/STATE.md`: member-state practice varies, and a tenant
whose authority requires the correction's own date would need a per-tenant
choice, which is deliberately not invented here.

**On the paper**, a foreign-currency invoice prints its VAT a second time in the
accounting currency, with the rate and the publication day beside it, in both the
HTML page and the PDF — so the figure can be recomputed from the document alone.
A document already in that currency prints one figure, not the same figure twice.

**Not built here:** the ECB's daily *XML* file (the CSV covers every published
period, and a second parser is a second thing to be wrong), a per-tenant choice
of credit-note rate, and ISO 4217 minor-unit exponents — every amount is stored
in hundredths, which is right for conversion and is a *display* question the
e-invoice of B1.22 has to answer.

### The designed quotation (as built)

The quotation studio lets a salesperson lay out content around the price
table — headings, paragraphs (in up to three columns), pull quotes, numbered
and bulleted lists with the studio's numbering library and three levels of
nesting, pictures with captions and text beside them, information tables,
dividers — and choose colours and which columns of the price table show.
Until this change that design lived only in the browser that composed it
(IndexedDB), so the document the customer received carried none of it.

- **The design is a record of the quote.** `billing_quote_designs` holds one
  JSON document per quote, whole; the web client owns its shape, the store
  bounds it (a JSON object, at most 12 MB — pictures travel inside it as data
  URLs, scaled down to 1600 px by the browser before they are stored) and
  freezes it with the offer: a `PUT` on a sent quote is a `409`, because the
  paper the customer holds does not change after the fact. A design the
  browser saved before this change is moved to the server the first time the
  quote is opened, then forgotten locally.
- **Both renderers read it** (`quote_design.rs`, read leniently — an unknown
  block kind is skipped, never a failed print). The page
  (`quote_design_print.rs`) renders every block as HTML in the print
  stylesheet's idiom; the PDF (`quote_design_pdf.rs`) sets the same blocks on
  the sheet with the document's own layout engine, pictures placed as JPEGs
  (`alo-pdf` places JPEGs and nothing else, so PNG and WebP are converted in
  `quote_design_images.rs` with the decoder Sites already trusts). Blocks
  before the studio's price-table block print above the table; the rest print
  after the totals. Hidden columns are absent from both.
- **Rich text is sanitised on the server** with the studio's own allow-list
  (`rich_text.rs`): bold and emphasis, paragraphs, headings and lists survive
  with no attributes; every character of text is escaped; nothing stored can
  become markup the list does not name.

What the printed forms do **not** yet carry, deliberately: the studio's
header styles, logo and contact QR, its table presentation options (totals
placement and detail, product images and descriptions), bold-within-a-
paragraph in the PDF (the standard fonts set one face per run), dashed and
dotted dividers in the PDF (drawn solid), and the split of one price table
into several — the studio keys those splits by on-screen rows, which have no
server identity, so the page prints one table. Each is a renderer change, not
a data change: the design already holds the fields.

### Preparing a customer email (as built, B1.18)

`POST /billing/invoices/{id}/send` **drafts, and never sends.** It renders the
invoice PDF, composes a short covering note, and saves the message in the
user's Drafts with `$draft`; the user reads it and sends it themselves through
the ordinary submission path — the one path that DKIM-signs, records, and is
audited. A billing route that put mail on the wire would be a second send path
drifting from the audited one, for no gain a review step does not already give.
It is the rule the agent's draft tools already follow (ADR 0034).

Three things are the server's, because a request must not be able to choose
where an invoice goes: the **recipient** (the customer's stored invoice
address — there is no `to` field on the route), the **author** (the caller's
own canonical address), and the **attachment** (rendered here, now, from the
stored document — never uploaded, never a client-supplied blob id). The only
caller input is `?lang=`, which picks the words of both the note and the
document, exactly as on `/print` and `/pdf`.

The refusals come from the document's own state: a **draft** carries no number
and prints a DRAFT banner, and a **void** invoice has been cancelled — both are
`409` naming the state. **Issued and paid** may be sent (re-sending a paid
invoice as a copy for the customer's records is legitimate). A customer with no
email address is `422`. Sending twice writes two drafts and changes no billing
record: the invoice has no "sent" state, and the mailbox is the record of what
was sent.

Quotations follow the same path through
`POST /billing/quotes/{id}/email-draft`. The lifecycle route `/send` first
assigns the quotation number and freezes its contents; the email-draft route
then renders that exact finalized PDF. It accepts open (`sent`) and accepted
quotations, refuses drafts and closed quotations, and remains tenant-scoped by
the same account door. Keeping the two operations separate makes mail
preparation safely retryable without consuming another number.

The Billing editor joins those operations into the normal primary action for a
new document, then opens the exact generated message in Mail. An already
numbered document offers **Prepare customer email** directly. A prepared
`$draft` has a prominent **Send** action in its reading toolbar; that action
uses Mail's existing submission queue and undo window. The journey is short,
but the interface never says a message was sent while it is only a draft.

The covering note is its own small string table (`billing_send.rs`), separate
from the document's: the document's wording is fixed by what it is in law, and
the note around it is a message between two people. **Both ship in en, fr and
nl (B1.27)**, and one `?lang=` picks the pair, so a French invoice can never
arrive under an English covering note — asserted by a test that compares the
two tables' tags for the same tag.

`/billing` is a **new top-level route prefix**: the production Caddyfile
needs it added at the next deploy. That is a human action recorded in
`docs/autonomy/STATE.md`, never a change the loop makes to `deploy/`.

### Chasing late money (as built, B1.26)

`POST /billing/invoices/{id}/reminder` is `/send`'s sibling: the letter that
asks for money instead of presenting a document, written into the caller's
Drafts and **never sent**. The overdue view of the invoice list carries the
click — one per late row, no confirmation, because writing a draft is not an
act on the document.

The request states nothing that matters. Who the letter goes to, what the
document is worth, what has already arrived, what is left and how many days
late it is are all read off the stored invoice, so a reminder and the invoice
it chases cannot disagree; the only caller inputs are `?lang=` and an optional
`note` bounded at 500 characters. The letter's figures come from the document's
own formatters (`billing_print`), and the day it is judged against is the
server's (`billing_document::today`) — a browser with a wrong clock can neither
invent nor clear a late invoice.

The refusals are the four documents that owe nothing: a **draft** was never
issued, a **void** invoice was cancelled, a **settled** one is settled, and a
**credit note** is money owed to the *customer*. Each is a `409` naming the
state rather than a letter nobody should send. A customer with no usable
address is `422`, and a foreign id is the `404` it is on every billing route.

Reminding twice writes two drafts and changes no billing record — proven on the
wire: the invoice row is byte-identical after two calls. There is no "reminded
on" column and no dunning schedule; automatic escalation is a B2 question, and
this is the manual click a person makes when they decide to chase.

The reminder's words are their own small table (`billing_reminder.rs`) beside
the covering note's, because they are a different letter with a different job.
Both are picked by the same `?lang=`, and both ship in en, fr and nl (B1.27) —
in the *interface* language of whoever clicks, which the web sends on the print
and reminder routes. A per-customer document language is a real want and a
different feature: it belongs on the customer record, not on the button. A
first reminder is deliberately a courtesy in all three languages — no interest,
no recovery costs, no formal notice, all of which are a decision a person takes
rather than a template (pinned by a test that reads the letter for those
words). The agent's
`draft_payment_reminder` (below) resolves an invoice *number* and then walks
through the same function, so the letter a person clicks for and the letter a
model proposes are one letter.

### The billing agent (as built, B1.25)

Three tools: `create_invoice_draft`, `quote_to_invoice`,
`draft_payment_reminder`. A product agent is a **tool list plus a paragraph**
(`alo-ai/src/agent_billing.rs`) and **executors** in the product's own module
(`alo-jmap/src/agent_billing.rs`, dispatched from the one
`POST /ai/agent/execute`). Since A1.2 those three are Billing's rather than
everybody's: `alo_ai::agent_product` maps the product on the agent's record to
its tool sets, `alo_ai::system_prompt_for` renders that product's prompt, and
`alo_ai::offers` is what the execution boundary asks before running anything —
so the Billing agent raises an invoice and the Inventory agent cannot.
`alo_ai::is_agent_tool` remains the allowlist of what exists at all, so a tool
cannot be described to a model without being executable, or the reverse; a test
asserts the two sets are equal.

Every tool ends in a **draft**. None issues a document, assigns a number, or
puts mail on the wire — the three irreversible acts of billing stay where a
human performs them deliberately, which is the same rule `/send` follows above.
There is no agent-only write path either: each executor calls the store
function the corresponding `/billing/*` route calls, so a document raised by the
agent obeys the same rules as one raised by the screen.

**Names in, ids out.** A model is given the words the user said and never an
opaque id. A customer or product name is resolved against *this tenant's* active
records — exact match first (so "Acme" reaches the customer literally called
Acme even when "Acme Holding BV" exists), then a unique containment; two matches
are a `422` **listing them**, never a guess, because an invoice sent to the
wrong company cannot be unsent. A document is found by its **number**
(`billing_invoice_id_by_number` / `billing_quote_id_by_number`, case-insensitive
and trimmed, otherwise exact). Numbers are per-tenant, so two tenants hold the
same number and the lookup is a tenancy boundary like any other — proven by
`billing_by_number.rs`, where B asking for A's number gets B's own document.

**Money arrives whole.** Prices are integer cents and VAT rates basis points; a
price with a decimal point is refused, never rounded. A quantity may be written
`1.5` and is read into milli-units **by its digits** (`milli_from_decimal`) — no
float multiplication anywhere, an exponent or a fourth decimal place refused.
Totals are the store's, computed before the header is written so a mistake in
the last line leaves no empty draft behind.

The reminder (`billing_reminder.rs`) is its own module and its own string
table, because it is a different letter from the covering note: it states how
late the document is, what is still owed, and what has already arrived. It
refuses everything that owes nothing — a draft, a void document, a settled one,
a credit note, or one with nothing outstanding — each a `409` naming the state.
It is deliberately **text only**: the customer already has the invoice, and
B1.26 is where the manual dunning view decides whether to re-attach it.

Two limits worth naming. Documents are **not in the agent's retrieval sources**
(the workspace index holds mail, files, tasks and events), so a billing tool is
proposed from what the user *said* — the prompt says so, and an unknown number
is a `422` rather than an invented document. And the propose path is not
grounded with the tenant's customer and product names, which would cost a read
on every agent turn for every user; a name that resolves to nothing comes back
with the candidates instead.


### Recurring invoices (as built, B2.11)

A **schedule** is a standing arrangement — "bill Acme €99 for hosting
every month" — and it lives in `billing_schedules` with its own template
lines in `billing_schedule_lines`, the same line model as an invoice's
(`billing_line`) so that raising the next one is a copy rather than a
translation. `crate::billing_cadence` holds the four rhythms (weekly,
monthly, quarterly, yearly) and the one pure function that steps a date.

Four decisions, each of which could have gone the other way:

- **A run raises drafts. It never issues.** Issuing spends a number out
  of a legally gapless series and freezes a document a customer and a tax
  authority may act on, so no unattended job of ours does it. This is
  also what `docs/features.md` [B2] asks for — "auto-draft for approval".
  The rejected alternative, auto-issuing behind a per-schedule "I trust
  this one" flag, is a setting whose worst case is a wrong numbered
  invoice in a customer's hands and a credit note to write; the cost of
  the safe version is one click a month.
- **The anchor is the start day, not the last landed day.** A monthly
  arrangement started on the 31st bills on the 28th in February and on
  the **31st again** in March. Advancing from the landed date instead —
  the obvious implementation — walks a 31st down to a 28th and leaves it
  there, so a monthly subscription silently becomes a "28th of the month"
  one after its first February. Weekly is plain seven-day arithmetic and
  consults no anchor, because a week has no month-end to clamp against.
- **A run catches up, up to a bound.** Three months missed is three
  drafts: they were three billable months, and a business that quietly
  skips two is losing money. One run raises at most
  `SCHEDULE_MAX_PER_RUN` (12) so a single call stays bounded, and the
  remainder follows on the next run an hour later. A start date may be
  backdated by up to a year and no further — beyond that it is a typo,
  not an arrangement.
- **A period is billed once, held so twice.** The run takes the
  schedule's row lock and moves `next_run_date` inside the same
  transaction, and the document itself records *which* occurrence it is
  for; `(tenant_id, schedule_id, schedule_due_date)` is unique in the
  database. Two runs racing cannot double-bill a month even if a future
  caller forgets the lock.

What an arrangement **is** — its customer, currency, terms and start date
— is not editable; its name, cadence, end date, reference, note and
template are. Changing the cadence does not move the next date: the
occurrence already scheduled stands, and the new rhythm applies from the
one after it. **Pausing** keeps every date and resumes where it left off
(the missed months were months the customer was under contract for);
**ending** is different and reads differently on screen — the arrangement
is still active and has simply run out of dates. An arrangement that has
raised documents is never deleted, only paused: its invoices point back
at it.

Two triggers, one call. `Store::sweep_billing_schedules` runs hourly in
`alo-jmap`'s background (beside the snooze and share sweeps), doing every
tenant's work through that tenant's own account door and as the
schedule's own owner, so the drafts are created by the colleague whose
standing instruction raised them. `POST /billing/schedules/run` is the
same store call for a bookkeeper who does not want to wait; both are safe
to run twice.

On screen, a **Recurring** tab lists the arrangements with what one
occurrence is worth, the next date and what has been raised, and every
draft a run produced wears a **Recurring** chip in the invoice list — the
one thing that explains why a document nobody typed is sitting there. An
arrangement is set up from an invoice ("Repeat this invoice"), which is
what supplies the customer, the currency, the terms and the lines: a
standalone form would need a second line editor, and a second line editor
is a second place for a price to be typed differently from the one on the
paper.

### Paying suppliers — the SEPA file (as built, B2.12)

The other direction of B1.24. A bill arrives, somebody approves it, and
then somebody has to actually pay it — which today means typing an IBAN
and an amount into online banking, per bill, with a typo waiting at every
one of them. Instead, the approved bills of a **payment run** become one
ISO 20022 `pain.001` customer-to-bank credit-transfer file, which is what
every European bank's upload form takes.

| Module | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `alo-store/billing_sepa.rs` | which bills may be paid, what the bank is told to move, and the record that we asked |
| `alo-jmap/billing_pain001.rs` | the message: element order, the two versions, the scheme's character set |
| `alo-jmap/billing_pain001_rules.rs` | the schema subset + EPC rules, checked over the bytes we emit |
| `alo-jmap/billing_sepa.rs` | the one route |

Six decisions, each of which could have gone the other way:

- **A bill goes into one payment run.** Paying a supplier twice is the
  accident this record type exists to prevent — `billing_bills` already
  refuses the same document being *imported* twice (0111), and this is the
  mirror of that rule on the way out. Migration 0117 stamps the run, the
  moment and the person on every bill a file covered, and a second run
  over one of them is a `409` naming the run it is already in. A
  deliberate `"repeat": true` is allowed and is a different act — the bank
  rejected the file, the file was lost — which reads as one in the record.
- **The mark is not a payment.** Nothing here sets a bill to *paid*: a
  file handed to a bank is an instruction, and the money moves when the
  bank says it moved, which arrives back as a statement line and is
  reconciled in B4.09. Calling this "paid" would book a settlement that
  may still be refused.
- **Plan, write, then record — in that order.** The store plans (reads,
  refuses, mints the run's `MsgId`) and writes nothing; the message is
  written and checked above the store; only then does the store record,
  re-checking every rule under each bill's row lock. So a renderer that
  failed can never leave a liability looking paid, and two bookkeepers
  exporting the same bill at the same moment still produce exactly one
  instruction. The rejected alternative — mark inside the planning
  transaction — is one panic away from a bill nobody will pay again.
- **Euro only, positive only, approved only — refused by name.** A
  foreign-currency bill is a different payment product a bank prices
  differently; a credit note is money coming back; an undecided bill is a
  claim rather than a liability. Each is refused with the bill's id, never
  silently skipped: a run that quietly paid *fewer* bills than the person
  selected is how a supplier goes unpaid.
- **Two versions, because it is a fact about the tenant's bank.**
  `pain.001.001.03` is what the EPC's implementation guidelines used until
  the 2023 rulebook and what nearly every bank's upload form still takes;
  `pain.001.001.09` is the 2019 ISO version some now require. They differ
  in three places — the namespace, `ReqdExctnDt` gaining a `<Dt>` wrapper,
  and `BIC` being renamed `BICFI` — so both are written from one model and
  pinned by golden files that differ in exactly those places. The default
  is `.03`; `"version"` on the request body chooses.
- **The character set is a presentation rule, so it lives with the
  writer.** A SEPA message carries only `a–z A–Z 0–9 / - ? : ( ) . , ' +`
  and space, and a tenant's data is not written in that set. `sepa_text`
  folds accents to their base letter, spells `ß` as `ss`, turns `&` into
  `+`, and replaces what has no reading at all with a space —
  `Müller & Söhne` reaches the bank as `Muller + Sohne`, recognisable
  rather than refused. The **store** keeps the supplier's name as their
  document wrote it: what a bank can spell and who was actually paid are
  two different facts.

`GET /billing/bills?payable=true` is the read a run is prepared from —
approved, not yet in a file, oldest liability first — kept as a flag
rather than a fourth status, because "already paid out" is not a decision
somebody made about the document, it is what has happened to it since.

**What the file does not carry**, each a deliberate cut: no `CdtrAgt`
without a BIC (a SEPA transfer has been IBAN-only since 2016, and a BIC
guessed from an IBAN would be an invention in a payment instruction); no
structured `Strd/CdtrRefInf` creditor reference (an `RF…` reference is
carried in the unstructured line the scheme guarantees delivery of —
claiming it is structured means validating it first, which is its own
item); and no direct debits (`pain.008` is collecting money, a different
mandate-bearing product).

**Not the XSD.** `billing_pain001_rules.rs` is a hand-written subset of
the schema and the EPC guidelines checked over the rendered bytes — every
required element, in the schema's sequence, with its data type, length and
character set — for the same reason the e-invoice checker is one: running
the normative artefacts means an XML Schema processor and a downloaded
binary in a public repository (`CLAUDE.md`). Validating the golden files
against the real XSD once, offline, and uploading one to a bank's test
facility are open human items in `docs/autonomy/STATE.md`.

## Data model

New `billing_*` store modules in `platform/alo-store` (one file per
responsibility, mirroring `tasks.rs` / `calendar.rs`). Every table
carries `tenant_id`, ids are `opaque_id!` newtypes, timestamps are
`timestamptz`, and **money is `i64` integer cents** with VAT rates in
**basis points** (`i32`, 2100 = 21 %). No floating point appears in any
column, struct field, or computation anywhere in this module.

- **`billing_customers`** — display name, address lines, postal code,
  city, country (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), VAT id (nullable — B2C customers
  have none), email, payment terms in days, default currency
  (ISO 4217), optional link to an existing `contacts` row, archived
  flag. Archive rather than delete: an issued invoice must always be
  able to name its customer.
- **`billing_products`** — name, unit, unit price cents, VAT rate bp,
  archived flag (as-built: an `archived_at` timestamp, the same shape as
  `billing_customers`, so the `/archive` route and the pickers behave
  identically across the module). Prices are in the tenant's default
  currency; the document carries the currency it was raised in, and
  B1.21's FX snapshot converts it for the books. A price-list *source* for lines, not a
  foreign key the line depends on — see the line snapshot rule below.
- **`billing_invoices`** — customer ref, status
  `draft | issued | paid | void`, currency, optional number (NULL while
  draft), issue date, due date, payment terms snapshot, credit-note
  type flag with a nullable `credits_invoice_id` self-reference, and
  the stored FX rate snapshot for multi-currency (B1.21 — **as built**).
  As-built (B1.06): also `reference` (the customer's PO number) and
  `note`, both printed on the document; the currency and terms are
  snapshotted from the customer when the draft is raised, and a new
  document cannot be raised for an **archived** customer. The
  status/number/date invariants are enforced by CHECK constraints as
  well as in Rust: a draft is exactly a document with no number and no
  dates, so an abandoned draft can never consume a number, and
  `(tenant_id, number)` is unique.
  As-built (B1.07): the draft-only rule is enforced on **every** write —
  header, lines and deletion — by re-reading the status under the row's
  `FOR UPDATE` lock inside the same transaction that writes, so an edit
  that raced an issue is refused (`Conflict`) rather than applied to a
  numbered document. The state refusal outranks any complaint about the
  payload, and deletion is draft-only: an issued document is voided,
  keeping its number so the sequence stays gapless.
  As-built (B1.09): a **credit note is an invoice in this same table**, not a
  second document type — it names its original in `credits_invoice_id`, carries
  that document's lines with their quantities negated, and goes through the same
  draft → issued life, drawing from the same series. Raising one copies the
  original's customer, currency, terms and customer reference (never the note:
  the original's "payable within 14 days" says the opposite of the truth on a
  credit note) and leaves it a **draft**, so a *partial* credit is simply a
  matter of editing its lines before issuing. The customer is copied rather than
  re-resolved, so an **archived** customer can still be credited — correcting a
  document already in their hands is not new business. While it is a draft a
  credit note is editable like any other, except that its customer and currency
  are pinned to the original's (`Validation`, `422`): a credit billed to
  somebody else reverses nothing. Only an `issued` or `paid` document can be
  credited; a draft (`Conflict`, `409` — delete it instead) and a void one
  (already cancelled in full) cannot, and neither can a credit note itself —
  that refusal is about what the document *is*, so it outranks and does not
  vary with its status. `GET`-side, `billing_credit_notes(original)` lists what
  credits a document, which is the ledger of a corrected invoice.
- **`billing_invoice_lines`** — invoice ref, line order, description,
  quantity in **milli-units** (`i64`; 1.5 h = 1500), unit price cents,
  VAT rate bp. Lines **snapshot** the product's description, price, and
  rate at the moment they are added; later edits to the price list
  never rewrite an existing document. This is the whole reason a line
  does not simply join to `billing_products`.
  As-built (B1.06): a document's lines are written as a **whole set** in
  one transaction, in the caller's order (`line_order` is 0-based and
  contiguous) — a draft editor sends the document it wants rather than a
  patch stream, so there is no half-edited state and no ambiguity about
  order. A negative quantity is legitimate (that is how a discount line
  is written); a negative unit price is not. The bounds — |qty| ≤ 10^9
  milli-units, price ≤ 10^9 cents, ≤ 500 lines — are what make the
  totals arithmetic provably `i64`-safe.
- **`billing_quotes`** + **`billing_quote_lines`** — the same line
  model (shared code where it stays clean, not a forced abstraction),
  lifecycle `draft | sent | accepted | declined | expired`, valid-until
  date, and a link from the invoice created on acceptance back to the
  quote.
  As-built (B1.11): the sharing is literal — `billing_line.rs` owns the
  line model, the field rules, the read, and the single `INSERT` both
  document types write through (`LineTable`, differing only in the table
  and the column naming the document). What is *not* shared is the life:
  a quote is its own table because an invoice is owed money under a
  legally gapless number while a quote is an offer that can simply be
  turned down, and folding them together would put a quote's states
  inside the CHECK that guards invoice numbering.
  **The lifecycle is one pure transition table** (`QuoteStatus::
  allowed_next`): `draft → sent`, `sent → accepted | declined |
  expired`, and nothing else — unit-tested over all twenty-five ordered
  pairs, including every self-transition, which is refused (re-sending
  would draw a second number). The three closing states are
  **terminal**: a change of mind is a new quote, so the document the
  customer holds and the record of what they were offered stay the same
  thing. A refusal names both states *and* what the current one does
  allow, so a UI corrects itself without a second round trip.
  **Sending** is the quote's issue: it draws from a `quote` series
  (`QUO-YYYY-NNNNN`, kind `quote` in `billing_sequences`) — deliberately
  not the invoice series, since an unaccepted offer must not leave a
  visible hole in invoice numbering — stamps `sent_date` from the
  database's own `CURRENT_DATE` inside the transaction, derives
  `valid_until` from the `valid_days` snapshotted on the document
  (default 30, range 0–365), and freezes the content. A quote with no
  lines cannot be sent (`Validation`, `422`), exactly as an empty
  invoice cannot be issued.
  **Expiry is a fact and a decision.** `Quote::is_expired(today)` is
  derived on every read like an invoice's overdue flag; moving the quote
  to `expired` is a separate recorded act with a `decided_date`. There
  is deliberately **no background sweep**, and acceptance refuses on
  *state*, never on a date — honouring a lapsed offer a few days late is
  a decision the tenant is entitled to make.
  As-built (B1.12): **accepting an offer and raising the invoice for it
  are one act**, in one transaction under the quote's row lock, and
  `accept_billing_quote` answers with both (`QuoteAcceptance`). Either
  the offer closes and its draft invoice exists or nothing happened: an
  accepted quote with nothing to bill it by would be unrepairable,
  because acceptance is terminal and no retry could finish the job. The
  link is `billing_invoices.quote_id` (migration 0106) — on the newer
  document, which knows its own origin, rather than on a quote that is
  frozen the moment it is sent — with a composite foreign key to the
  same tenant and a **unique** partial index: one invoice per accepted
  offer, ever, so "the invoice raised from this quote" is a single row.
  A credit note may never carry one (CHECK), since it credits an
  invoice, not an offer.
  What the invoice copies: the customer, the currency and the customer's
  reference, plus every line unchanged at the price it was offered at,
  in the offer's order (`Line::copied`) — so the totals agree to the
  cent, including the VAT breakdown per rate. What it does not: the
  **note** (a quote's note states the terms of an *offer*, which is
  untrue of a bill) and the **payment terms**, which a quote does not
  carry and are taken from the customer as any new invoice's are. The
  customer is copied, not re-resolved, so an offer to a customer
  archived since it was sent can still be honoured — as a credit note
  can still be raised for one — while raising a *new* quote for them
  stays refused. The invoice is a **draft**: what was offered is what
  will be billed, but when, and whether in one go, is the tenant's
  decision, and the legal number comes only from `/issue`.
- **`billing_payments`** (B1.19) — invoice ref, `paid_on` (the day the
  bank shows, not the day it was keyed in), amount cents (strictly
  positive, DB `CHECK`), method (free text — the set varies per member
  state, and B4 maps methods to ledger accounts with a per-tenant table
  rather than a hardcoded enum), reference. Invoice paid-state is
  **derived** from the sum of its payments against its gross total,
  never stored as an independently writable field that could disagree
  with the ledger; the `status` column carries the one settled/not bit
  as a projection recomputed under the invoice's row lock.
- **`billing_bills`** + **`billing_bill_lines`** (B1.24) — a supplier's
  invoice, read out of the e-invoice file they sent: the syntax it
  arrived in and the SHA-256 of those bytes, the supplier copied across
  (no foreign key — a supplier master record is B5.03), their number,
  their dates, their currency, the stated totals (BT-106 … BT-115) in
  ledger direction, and `received | approved | rejected` with who
  decided and when. `UNIQUE (tenant_id, supplier_key, number)` is what
  makes the same invoice, forwarded twice, one bill. The lines are the
  same shape as an invoice's, written by the same `billing_line`
  module — their line and ours describe the same thing.
- **`billing_sequences`** — `(tenant_id, kind, year, next_value)`, the
  row-locked counter behind legal numbering (below).
- **`billing_settings`** (B1.16) — **one row per tenant**, the issuer
  side of every document: legal name, address, country, VAT id,
  company registration number, contact email/phone/website, and the
  bank the money goes to (IBAN, BIC, account holder). Tenant-wide, as
  customers and products are: a tenant issues under one identity.
  The row is created on first save; a tenant that has never saved reads
  the **blanks**, never a `404` — a print view asking "have you
  configured billing yet" would be a second source of truth about a
  record that always conceptually exists. The IBAN is held to its
  ISO 13616 length-per-country **and its mod-97 check** (`iban.rs`), the
  same standard the VAT id gets: a typo'd IBAN is money that never
  arrives, and it is caught at the point of entry or not at all.

### Totals

Totals are a **pure function** over lines (B1.06), never a stored
column the client can influence:

```
line_net   = round(qty_milli × unit_price_cents / 1000)
net        = Σ line_net
vat_by_rate[r] = round(Σ line_net where rate = r × r / 10_000)
gross      = net + Σ vat_by_rate
```

Rounding is at the **VAT-rate subtotal**, not per line — the EN 16931 /
VAT-directive convention (BR-CO-17: the category tax amount is the
category taxable amount times the rate) — and the property tests assert
that line sums always reconcile to the returned totals for randomly
generated documents. The client renders what the API returns; the web
layer never computes money (B1.14).

As-built (B1.06), one decision the first sketch left open: `round` is
half **away from zero**, not half up. The two agree on positive amounts;
they differ on negatives, and away-from-zero is what makes a credit note
the exact mirror of the document it credits — `totals(−lines) ==
−totals(lines)`, asserted as a property. Half-up would leave a one-cent
residue on any document whose credit rounds at a half, and a ledger that
does not sum to zero is an accounting defect, not a rounding taste.
Every intermediate is computed in `i128` and narrowed with saturation,
so the function is total for any input a future caller hands it.

## Errors

Store errors are `StoreError` variants (`thiserror`), mapped at the
route edge to the existing `Problem` shape. The full map:

| Condition | Store | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthenticated request | — | `401` |
| Customer/product/invoice id absent **or owned by another tenant** | `NotFound` | `404` |
| Malformed VAT id for the customer's country | `Validation` | `422` |
| Negative quantity, negative unit price, unknown currency, VAT rate outside 0–10000 bp | `Validation` | `422` |
| Editing lines **or the header** of a non-draft invoice | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Deleting a non-draft invoice (it is voided, never deleted) | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Issuing an already-issued invoice | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Issuing an invoice with no lines | `Validation` | `422` |
| Voiding anything but an issued invoice | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Crediting a draft (never-issued) invoice | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Crediting a void invoice (already cancelled in full) | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Crediting a credit note | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Moving a credit note off its original's customer or currency | `Validation` | `422` |
| Creating an invoice without naming a customer (`customerId` absent or blank) | — (route edge) | `422` |
| Listing with a `status` filter that is not one of the four states | — (route edge) | `422` |
| Payment amount ≤ 0, or beyond the ceiling, or dated in the future | `Validation` | `422` |
| `paidOn` that is not exactly `YYYY-MM-DD` | — (route edge) | `422` |
| Recording a payment against a draft, a void invoice, or a credit note | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Voiding an invoice money has been received against | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Removing a payment that is absent, another document's, or another tenant's | `NotFound` | `404` |
| Invalid quote transition (e.g. `declined` → `accepted`) | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Editing, replacing the lines of, or deleting a non-draft quote | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Sending a quote with no lines | `Validation` | `422` |
| Quote validity outside 0–365 days | `Validation` | `422` |
| Accepting a quote that is not an open offer (draft, or already answered) | `Conflict` | `409` |
| Creating a quote without naming a customer (`customerId` absent or blank) | — (route edge) | `422` |
| Listing quotes with a `status` filter that is not one of the five states | — (route edge) | `422` |
| Saving billing settings without a legal name | `Validation` | `422` |
| Malformed issuer VAT id, IBAN (length or mod-97) or BIC | `Validation` | `422` |
| Printing a document that is absent **or another tenant's** | `NotFound` | `404` |
| Sequence row contention beyond the tx retry | `Db` | `503` |

The wrong-tenant case deliberately returns the **same `404`** as a
truly absent id: there is no existence oracle across tenants, matching
the `StoreError::NotFound` doctrine already documented in
`platform/alo-store/src/error.rs`.

## Tenancy

Every billing table carries `tenant_id`, and every read and write goes
through `Store::for_account(tenant, user)` — the `AccountStore` door
that bakes `(tenant, user)` into the query rather than accepting a
tenant argument a caller could get wrong. No billing function takes a
`TenantId` parameter; the handle is the scope.

Concretely:

- Every `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` includes `tenant_id = $1` from
  the handle, never from request input.
- Foreign keys are validated **within the tenant**: attaching a
  customer to an invoice re-checks that the customer id resolves under
  the same handle, so a guessed id from another tenant is a `404`, not
  a cross-tenant link.
- The numbering sequence is keyed by tenant, so two tenants issuing
  concurrently never share a counter.
- **Every B1 storage item ships a wrong-tenant test** (mandatory per
  CLAUDE.md and LOOP.md): tenant A reaching tenant B's customer,
  product, invoice, quote, and payment each gets a clean denial —
  proven by a test, not asserted in prose.

## Numbering — the decision

**Chosen:** a per-tenant row in `billing_sequences`, selected
`FOR UPDATE` **inside the same transaction** that writes the invoice
number, issue date, and frozen status. Format `INV-YYYY-NNNNN`, the
counter resetting per year, credit notes drawing from the same sequence
so the ledger stays continuous.

**Rejected: a Postgres `SEQUENCE` / `nextval()`.** Sequences are
deliberately non-transactional — a rolled-back or failed transaction
**burns** the number it drew, leaving a permanent gap. Gapless
numbering is a legal requirement for invoices across the EU
(§14 UStG in DE, and the equivalent in FR/BE/NL), so the very property
that makes `nextval()` fast and contention-free is the property that
makes it unusable here. Row locking serialises issuance per tenant,
which is correct and cheap at SME volume; B1.08's concurrency test
asserts across 100 iterations that two parallel issues never share or
skip a number.

Drafts stay **unnumbered** (`number IS NULL`) precisely so an abandoned
draft cannot consume a number, and issuing is the only transition that
assigns one.

### As-built (B1.08)

- The row is `(tenant_id, kind, year) → next_value`, created on first
  use at 2 (handing out 1) by the same upsert that advances it, so a
  never-used series has no row at all. `kind` is shape-checked rather
  than list-checked: quotes (B1.11) add a row, never a migration.
  The upsert holds the counter's row lock until the issuing transaction
  ends, which is the `FOR UPDATE` this section promised, in one
  statement.
- **The issue date is the database's `CURRENT_DATE`, read inside the
  issuing transaction — not a caller-supplied date.** A series whose
  numbers ascend while their dates do not is not gapless in any sense a
  tax authority accepts, and backdating is how that happens. The due
  date is that day plus the terms already snapshotted on the document.
  *Flagged for human review:* bookkeepers do sometimes need to issue
  "as of" an earlier day (a month-end run done on the 3rd). Offering it
  needs a rule that keeps number order and date order together — its own
  queue item, not a quiet parameter.
- **An invoice with no lines cannot be issued** (`Validation`, `422`).
  It would be worth nothing and would spend a number of a legally
  unbroken series on a document that says nothing.
- **Voiding** is available only from `issued`: a draft is deleted (it
  took no number), a void document is already void, and a **paid** one
  is corrected with a credit note (B1.09), not cancelled by fiat. A
  voided document keeps its number, dates and lines — that is what keeps
  the series unbroken — and stays readable. Voiding suits a document
  that never left the building; one the customer already holds should be
  credited instead, so both parties' copies still reconcile. The store
  cannot tell those apart, so it allows the transition and says so.
- Issuing takes the **document's** lock before the **counter's**, in
  that order on every path, so concurrent issues queue instead of
  deadlocking, and a save that raced an issue is refused rather than
  landing on a numbered document.

## Out of scope for B1

Deliberate cuts, each a decision rather than an omission:

- **Payroll and tax filing** — excluded by ADR 0035; we export, we do
  not file.
- **Peppol network membership** — B1 sends via a certified access
  point; obtaining our own AP account is a human action logged in
  STATE.md, not loop work.
- **Live PSD2 bank feeds** — reconciliation arrives in B4 from imported
  statements (CAMT.053/MT940/CSV); no licensed aggregator in B1.
- **Payment links / PSP integration** — explicitly B2 in
  `docs/features.md`. (**Recurring invoices** were also out of scope for
  B1 and are now built; see "Recurring invoices" below.)
- **Customer self-service portal** — tagged `[B+]`, post-traction.
- **Automatic sending of any email** — B1.18 and B1.26 create Drafts
  the user approves, consistent with the ADR 0034 agent send rules and
  the loop's absolute no-real-email rail.
- **Live AI model calls in the loop** — the billing agent (B1.25) is
  verified structurally: routes exist, guards return 401/422, executors
  run against the local DB. Model wiring is a human step.



## What B1 promised, and what B1 shipped (B1.27)

Every `[B1]` line of `docs/features.md` § Business modules, reconciled
against the code. Nothing on that list is silently missing: each line is
either shipped, or a cut with the reason and where it goes instead.

| `[B1]` feature | State | Where / why |
|---|---|---|
| ★ Billing agent (draft, convert, chase) | **Shipped**, narrowed | B1.25: `create_invoice_draft`, `quote_to_invoice`, `draft_payment_reminder`, propose-then-approve. **Two narrowings:** the agent *drafts* the mail and never sends it (ADR 0034 + the note above), and "chase everyone overdue >14 days" is one invoice per call — a bulk chase writes a dozen letters from one approval, which needs its own confirmation and is a B2 item. |
| Customer records (address, VAT id, terms, currency, Contacts link) | **Shipped** | B1.02, B1.03, B1.05. VAT id is a **format** check (14 member states also check-digit-verified); a live VIES *existence* lookup is a network call and its own item. |
| Products/services price list | **Shipped** | B1.04, B1.05. |
| Quote record with server-side totals, integer cents | **Shipped** | B1.11 on the shared line model and `billing_totals`. |
| Quote lifecycle draft → sent → accepted/declined/expired; accept → invoice | **Shipped** | B1.11, B1.12, B1.15. Finalizing freezes and numbers the quote; `/email-draft` prepares the localized covering message and attached PDF through alo Mail. |
| Invoice record (line model, issue/due dates, terms) | **Shipped** | B1.06. |
| Legal gapless per-tenant numbering, immutable once issued | **Shipped** | B1.08, with the 100-parallel-issue test and a rollback test. **Flagged:** no backdated issuing — the strict reading (numbers and dates ascend together). |
| Credit notes referencing the original | **Shipped** | B1.09. **Cut:** no over-credit guard (needs B1.19's derived state; the read it would use exists). |
| PDF with tenant branding (logo, footer, bank details) | **Shipped**, one cut | B1.16, B1.17. **Cut:** the logo is a **monogram** drawn from the legal name — a real logo is a Drive file plus an upload surface, which is its own item. |
| ★ EN 16931: Factur-X + XRechnung, schematron-validated | **Shipped** | B1.22 (CII in PDF/A-3), B1.23 (UBL 2.1), both schematron-clean in the test suite. |
| ★ Peppol send/receive via an access point | **NOT SHIPPED — human item** | Needs a contract with a certified access point and credentials; the loop cannot obtain either, and never touches production. ROADMAP B1.9, and the standing human-action entry in `docs/autonomy/STATE.md`. The file formats it would carry are done. |
| E-invoice **receiving** → bill record | **Shipped**, one cut | B1.24, both official sample sets. **Cut:** the XML *inside* a supplier's PDF is not extracted — upload the XML itself, and a PDF says so plainly. |
| Payment tracking: paid/partial, method, reference, overdue view | **Shipped** | B1.19. |
| Reminders/dunning: manual first, then scheduled sequences | **Manual shipped; scheduled deferred** | B1.26 is the manual click. A first/second/final-notice schedule needs state on the document and a job that acts unattended — explicitly B2. |
| VAT summary per period + CSV | **Shipped** | B1.20. |
| Multi-currency with a stored ECB rate at issue | **Shipped**, one cut | B1.21 stores the rate on the document at issue. **Cut:** nothing is fetched — rates are seeded by hand or imported from an eurofxref-shaped file, deliberately, so what the books are converted at is a file the tenant chose. |
| *Cross-cutting:* tenant-scoped with mail-grade isolation tests | **Shipped** | Every billing store module has a wrong-tenant suite; the routes re-prove it through the real router. |
| *Cross-cutting:* every record links to its mail threads, files, tasks | **NOT SHIPPED** | No billing record links to a thread, file or task in B1. Deal↔thread linking is B2.05 and is where the pattern is designed; billing joins it there rather than inventing a second one. |
| *Cross-cutting:* every module's numbers visible to Ask alo | **NOT SHIPPED** | B1.25's cut: the workspace index holds mail, files, tasks and events, not documents, so the agent acts on what the user *said* and an unknown number is a clean `422`. Indexing invoices and quotes for retrieval is a real item a human should schedule. |

Not in the table because they are not `[B1]`: recurring invoices (built
at B2.11, above), payment links and SEPA export are tagged `[B2]`, and
the customer portal `[B+]`.
