# Changelog

- Chat now has a cleaner, responsive Tailwind interface with clearer room navigation, message actions, people management, and a compact composer that reveals tools only when needed.
- HR teams can now create and maintain approved letter templates in the People module, using the server-provided placeholder vocabulary and clear safeguards around deletion and sending.
- Meet participants can now reopen and share a meeting URL, raise or lower a hand, and send lightweight in-call reactions; controls use alo styling and are translated in English, Dutch, and French.

User- and operator-visible changes, written when the knowledge is
fresh (release skill). Versions follow SemVer against public
contracts.

## Unreleased

- **You can now have a one-to-one with an agent, the way you have one with a
  colleague.** Open a conversation with the Mail agent and simply ask — no `@`,
  no room to set up, nothing to invite it to. Everything you say there is for
  it, and only you can see the conversation: each person's one-to-one with an
  agent is their own, it never appears in anyone else's list or in the channels
  you can browse, and asking the same agent again re-opens the conversation you
  already have rather than starting a new one. Everywhere else nothing changes —
  in a channel you still name an agent to ask it something, and anything it
  wants to *change* still waits for your tap.

- **An agent now looks in its own product, and not through everything you
  own.** Ask the Mail agent about a customer and it reads your correspondence
  and your address book; ask the Agenda agent and it reads your diary; ask the
  Chat agent and it reads the rooms you are already in. None of them is handed
  your files, and no agent is handed anything from a product that is not its
  own — where before every agent was given the same eight results from one
  search across your whole workspace, whatever it was the agent of. The
  business agents — Billing, CRM, Projects, Finance, Inventory, People — look
  their records up as they answer instead, so a stock question is answered from
  stock rather than from something in your inbox that happened to mention it.
  "Ask alo" is unchanged: it is still the one assistant that looks everywhere.

- **An agent now belongs to a product, and only does that product's work.** Each
  agent is created as the agent *of* something — Mail, Agenda, Inventory, People
  and so on — and is given that product's tools and no others. Ask the Inventory
  agent what is in your diary and it tells you that is the Agenda agent's
  question rather than answering from whatever a search turned up; if it reaches
  for another product's tool anyway, nothing runs, including when you approve
  it. "Ask alo" is unchanged: it is the one assistant that deliberately works
  across every product. Existing agents keep the reach they have today unless
  their handle already named a product.

- **Groundwork for the website assistant: it can only ever know what your
  visitors already see.** The upcoming site chatbot's reading list is now
  fixed in the foundations: the published version of your website, blog posts
  that are live, and documents you deliberately publish to it from Drive —
  one at a time, each past a clear warning, never a whole folder. Drafts,
  scheduled publishes that have not run yet, past versions and everything
  else in your workspace are unreadable to it by construction, and a
  document you trash stops counting immediately. The rule is one sentence:
  whatever the assistant can read, the internet can read.

- **Ask an agent a question and get the answer, not a button.** "Is the X100 in
  stock?", "what's on tomorrow?", "who's off next week?" — the agent now looks
  it up while it is answering you and replies with the figure, citing the record
  it read. Only a tool that *changes* something — sending mail, creating a task,
  moving a deal — still asks you to approve it first, which was always the point
  of the approval. An agent may look things up a few times for one question; if
  that is not enough it says what it could not find out rather than guessing.
  Everything it runs, looked up or approved, is recorded against your own
  account, and it still reaches only what you can reach.

- **The website screen now works on a phone.** The site's page (with
  publishing, collaborators, languages, and the page list) scrolls as one
  document on a small screen, so the page list is reachable again, and the
  Publish button no longer sits past the edge of the screen when the site is
  live.
- **New website sections start as your website, not as filler.** The Add
  section panel now shows every block filled with what you have already
  written — your pages become the menu and the footer, your name and your own
  line the banner, your pictures the gallery — and picking a tile shows it
  rendered in your website's own look before you add it. Drag a tile onto the
  page where you want it, or choose the position and press the tile; both do
  exactly the same thing. A block nothing of yours fits yet — a quote, a
  price, your team — says what it needs instead of inventing one, and opens
  the familiar form. Nothing is ever written for you: every word a tile
  carries is one you already put on the website.

- **Website sections can now change shape, within the shapes they have.** A
  text-and-image section moves between a wider image, equal halves and wider
  text; a features, gallery or team section shows two, three or four cards
  across on a wide screen; an image can be shown as uploaded, wide, square or
  tall. Pick a size under the section in the list, or move through the preview
  to a section and hold Alt with the left or right arrow. Whatever you choose,
  a phone still shows one column and a tablet at most two — the choice is a
  ceiling for big screens, not something that can break the page on a small
  one. It is the same kind of change the assistant makes, so it shows up the
  same way and Undo (⌘Z / Ctrl+Z) takes it back like any other. Websites you
  have never resized look exactly as they did.

- **Website sections are now moved by dragging them on the page.** Pick a
  section up in the preview and the page rearranges as you drag, so you see the
  new order rather than imagining it from a list. With the keyboard, move
  through the preview to a section and hold Alt with the up or down arrow —
  focus stays on the section you moved, so you can walk it down the page.
  The move buttons beside the section list still do exactly the same thing, and
  Undo (⌘Z / Ctrl+Z) now takes back a move as well as a text change, in the
  order you made them.

- **Website text is now edited on the page itself.** Click a heading, a
  paragraph, a question or a price tier's name in the website preview and type:
  Enter saves it, Escape puts the old words back, and Undo (⌘Z / Ctrl+Z, or the
  arrows above the section list) walks back through every change. It is the same
  change the assistant makes when you ask it to rewrite something, so both show
  up the same way and both can be taken back the same way. Text that shares a
  line with something else — a testimonial's author beside their role, a price
  beside its billing period — is still edited in the section form.

- **For operators: buying domains inside alo stays switched off until a
  deployment says who sells them.** The buy box only appears when the server
  is started with a registrar (`SITE_REGISTRAR`), the nameservers every
  registration is created with (`SITE_NAMESERVERS`), and a settlement secret
  of at least 24 bytes (`SITE_PAYMENT_SETTLEMENT_SECRET`) that the payment
  bridge must present. With any of them missing — which is every deployment
  today, since no reseller has been named — websites show the connect-a-domain
  path instead, nothing can be paid for, and no registration worker runs.
  Once they are set, a paid purchase is registered by a background sweep
  inside the workspace API every sixty seconds and the name is attached to its
  website automatically; the alo Sites design note lists the whole set of
  Sites deployment keys in one place.

- **Fixed: website analytics were unreadable on a phone, and reordering a page
  with the keyboard threw you back to the top.** On a 360px screen the analytics
  panels sat two to a row, which left no width for the labels: "Countries"
  showed four bars and four numbers with no country named against any of them,
  and 29 labels across the screen were drawn at zero width. The panels now take
  the full width of a phone and each bar sits under its own label. The Languages
  panel on a website's screen ran 44px off the side, taking the state of every
  language with it; it now wraps. In the page editor, the buttons on each
  section are now named after the section they act on — "Move Hero down", not a
  fifth button called "Move down" — moving a section keeps the cursor on that
  section instead of dropping it at the top of the page, and the move is
  announced for anyone who cannot see the page reflow. Several small labels, the
  editing-language chip and the status colours across the website screens were
  darkened to stay legible.

- **Fixed: the website dialogs can now be used without a mouse, and they fit a
  phone.** Opening a dialog — new website, new page, theme, publish, the picker
  you add a section from, any of them — now moves the cursor into it, keeps Tab
  inside it instead of walking onto the page it is covering, closes on Escape
  from the moment it opens, and hands focus back to whatever you pressed to
  open it. The cross in the corner is called Close, so it is no longer the
  second thing named Cancel in the same box. Six website screens — analytics,
  funnel, heatmap, catalogue, bookings and collections — offered a screen
  reader two "main" regions to jump to; now they offer the one that is really
  there. On a phone, the title bars, the list headings and the paired fields in
  the dialogs now stack instead of running off the side of the screen.

- **Fixed: people invited to help with a website could not open it.** A
  collaborator invited to one website was refused everywhere in alo — including
  the website they had just been invited to — because the check that keeps them
  to that one site did not recognise the address the app actually calls. Their
  invitations, sites, pages and publishing now work as they were meant to, and
  everything the invitation does not cover stays shut exactly as before: the
  rest of the workspace, this website's other collaborators, its domain
  purchases, and the customer records held in alo CRM and Billing.

- **Your website now has a Domains screen, and it tells you what a domain really
  costs.** Connect a domain you already own — add it, publish the exact record
  shown at your DNS host, press Check, and if it has not travelled yet the screen
  says so instead of calling it an error — or search for a new one. Wherever a
  price appears, both halves appear: what the name costs today and what it costs
  every year after it. Buying is two deliberate steps, and no price ever travels
  from your browser: you fill in who the domain is registered to, alo asks the
  seller what it costs, and you approve those exact amounts. After that the
  record of the purchase says what is happening and what happens next, right
  through to the name serving your website — and if something goes wrong you get
  the registrar's own sentence about it, including what it means for the money.
  A workspace where domain selling has not been switched on says so plainly and
  points you at connecting one you own.

- **The custom-code block can now be written in the website editor.** Add it
  from the section picker like any other block: a heading for the page, the name
  a screen reader reads out, and the markup, style and script in three separate
  boxes that count what you have written against what fits. Above them, before
  you type anything, is what the block can and cannot do — it is sealed off from
  your site, it has no internet access, and it is your code, published as you
  wrote it. Two switches say what it is allowed to do, both off until you turn
  them on; the script box only appears once you allow a script, and turning that
  back off tells you the script goes with it before you save rather than after.
  The preview beside the editor shows the block exactly as a visitor will get
  it, and anything the server refuses comes back in its own words with
  everything you typed still in place.

- **A page on your website can now hold a piece of your own HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript.** It is published inside a sealed frame of its own: your code
  cannot read the page around it, and — this is deliberate — it cannot reach the
  internet at all. Nothing it might load from somewhere else will appear, which
  is why your visitors still need no cookie banner. Scripts run only if you say
  the block has a script, and the editor refuses code that would break out of
  its frame, naming the rule it broke rather than failing silently. Because the
  frame is sealed, you say how tall it is. The assistant will move or delete
  such a block, but never write one and never rewrite what is in it: code on
  your site is written by someone who meant to write it.

- **Every dialog in the admin console, the calendar and the sign-in screens can
  now be closed with the keyboard, and every control in them says what it is.**
  Escape closes them; Tab stays inside them instead of wandering onto the page
  behind. In Users & mailboxes each admin switch names the colleague it grants
  access to, rather than being twenty identical unlabelled boxes, and it is
  announced as on or off instead of ticked. The role and app switches say what
  turning them on does, out loud as well as on screen. Every text box and
  dropdown — sharing a calendar, adding a member, adding an alias, registering
  a domain — is now attached to the words beside it, so a screen reader reads
  the question rather than the current answer. Removing somebody says whose
  access is being removed. Selects and text boxes in these screens are a little
  taller, matching the rest of the product, and they show a proper focus ring.

- **You can now set up what your website takes bookings for, without leaving the
  editor.** A Bookings screen on each website lists what can be booked, and one
  panel holds the whole decision: what it is called, which of your calendars the
  appointments are written into, how long it takes, the gap you keep after it,
  the notice you ask for, how far ahead it opens, the hours you are open for it,
  and the questions a visitor answers on top of their name and email. Beside it,
  what a visitor will see. If your account has no calendar to book into, the
  screen says so instead of showing an empty list to choose from; if the
  calendar a service was booked into is deleted or unshared, that is stated
  where you would otherwise have found out from a visitor's complaint. A link
  goes straight to Agenda, where the appointments themselves are managed. A page
  offers one of these services through a new Booking section, which lists what
  your site actually has — so a page can no longer promise something that does
  not exist. In English, Dutch and French.

- **A booking on your website now also arrives in your inbox.** Within half a
  minute of a visitor taking an appointment you get an ordinary email saying
  what they booked, when — written on the clock you offered it in, with the
  zone named — who they are and what they answered to your own questions.
  Replying to it answers the visitor: their address is the reply address, so
  confirming a booking is one reply and nothing is sent in your name without
  you. The appointment is in your calendar either way; this is the second
  telling, for the days you do not look at the calendar first. It arrives once
  and only once, and only ever in the inbox of the workspace the website
  belongs to.

- **Visitors can now book an appointment on a published website, and it lands
  in your calendar.** A page carries what you offer — the name, how long it
  takes, where it happens — and a day field. Choosing a day shows exactly the
  times you are still free: your opening hours for that day, minus whatever is
  already in the bound calendar, minus the appointments other visitors have
  taken, with the gap you asked to keep between appointments and the notice you
  asked for respected. The visitor picks a time, gives a name and an address,
  answers your own questions, and presses one button. Nothing about it needs
  JavaScript, so it works on any browser and any phone. The moment it is taken
  the appointment appears in your calendar — with the visitor's address and
  their answers in the event, so you can simply reply — and it disappears from
  what the next visitor is offered. Two people pressing *book* on the same time
  in the same second cannot both get it: one is confirmed, the other is told
  the time has just been taken and shown what is still free. Times are always
  shown on your own clock, including on the two days a year the clocks change:
  an hour that does not exist is never offered, and an hour that happens twice
  is offered once. Nothing about a visitor's connection is recorded — an
  appointment is what they typed, and the time it is for.

- **A website can now describe what it can be booked for, in the calendar you
  already keep.** A booking service says what it is called, how long it takes,
  which of your calendars the appointment belongs in, and the hours of the week
  you offer it — written on your own clock, so a change of daylight saving
  moves the appointments with it rather than an hour off. On top of the name
  and email every booking asks for, you add the questions your trade actually
  needs: a phone number, a registration plate, which treatment, each optional
  or required. A calendar somebody shared with you for reading only is offered
  but explained, rather than quietly missing, because an appointment has to be
  written somewhere; and if a calendar is later deleted or unshared, the
  service says its connection is broken instead of showing an empty week.
  Visitors cannot book yet — this is the record the booking page will be made
  from.

- **Anything you offer can now be photographed.** An item in a catalog takes a
  picture — chosen from your computer, kept in Drive like every other image on
  your site — and the card on the published page shows it. Beside it you say
  what the photo shows, in a line read aloud to visitors who cannot see it;
  until you write one, the card falls back to the item's name rather than
  publishing a picture nobody described. Items without a photo are not
  second-class: they still appear, with their name, price and description, and
  the form says so instead of looking unfinished. Replacing or removing a photo
  takes its description with it, so nothing is left describing a picture that
  is no longer there.

- **A catalog can now be put on a page, and what visitors order arrives in a
  screen made for answering it.** The section picker gains Catalog: choose
  which price list the page shows and, if you want, a single group of it — the
  lunch menu, the double rooms — and the page carries an order form whenever
  that catalog takes orders. The orders themselves get their own inbox beside
  the contact one: the queue on the left, the order beside it with what was
  asked for, how many, the price each and the total in the catalog's own
  currency. Move an order between New, Confirmed, Done and Cancelled in one
  click and in either direction — an order cancelled by mistake is confirmed
  again rather than re-typed — filter the queue by state, and export the lot
  as a spreadsheet, one row per ordered line so the numbers can be summed.
  An item that carries no price is shown as on request and adds nothing to the
  total, rather than counting as free. Deleting an order removes the customer's
  name, phone number and request for good, so it asks once first.

- **A website can now be given a catalog of what it offers, from a screen
  rather than from the database.** Sites gains a Catalog screen: create a
  price list, give it a currency, add the dishes, rooms, services or courses
  it holds, and group them under headings. A price is written the way it would
  be on a menu — `4.50` or `4,50`, with or without the currency sign — and the
  server reads it; an item left without one shows "price on request" rather
  than nothing or zero. An item can be marked sold out, which still shows it,
  or hidden, which does not publish it at all. One switch on the catalog turns
  on the order form under it — nothing is ever paid on the website; the order
  arrives in the owner's inbox — and, like every price here, it reaches the
  live site at the next publish, not before. Correcting a name no longer
  changes the short handle underneath it, so a page that shows one group keeps
  showing it.

- **Drive's dialogs can now be closed with Escape, and its Base grids say what
  each cell is.** "Move to…", version history and a Space's members keep the
  keyboard inside them while they are open — before, Tab walked straight out
  onto the file list behind, where a screen reader read out files you could no
  longer reach — Escape closes them, and closing one puts the cursor back on
  whatever you opened it from. On the members list, each Remove button now
  names the person it removes rather than every row saying only "Remove", and
  the box and dropdown for adding someone say what they are for instead of the
  dropdown being announced as whichever role it currently shows. In a Base,
  every cell you type into now carries its column's name, so a row read aloud
  is Budget and Owner rather than eight anonymous edit fields. Some of this
  looks slightly different: the three dialogs sit on the same panel as every
  other dialog in alo, and the coloured tags on a Base's choice fields are the
  shared ones — same shape and spacing as the tags elsewhere in the product,
  still carrying the colour that tells one choice from another.
- **Settings can now be closed with Escape, and every box in it says what it
  is for.** The Settings panel keeps the keyboard inside it while it is open —
  before, Tab walked straight out onto the mailbox behind — and Escape closes
  it. Out-of-office is now a real switch, announced as on or off with the
  sentence under it read out rather than only shown, and its Subject and
  Message boxes have proper labels instead of grey hint text that vanished the
  moment you typed. In Filters & rules, each rule's on/off box now says which
  rule it belongs to, each condition's three controls are numbered ("Condition
  2: field") instead of being announced as whatever they currently say, and the
  folder picker beside "Move to folder" is its own control — clicking its words
  no longer ticks the box next to it. On the Sharing tab, the two buttons on
  each row name the colleague they act on ("Remove ben@example.com's access")
  rather than repeating "Remove access" once per person, the folder button says
  whether its list is open, and each folder box carries its folder's name. Some
  of this looks slightly different: Settings is a little narrower and sits on
  the same panel as every other dialog in alo, Cancel and Close are now
  outlined buttons rather than plain text, and the search box, the switches and
  the dropdowns throughout are the shared ones — same height, same focus ring,
  visible when they are switched off.
- **Visitors can now order from your catalog, without a checkout.** Switch
  ordering on for a catalog and every published page showing it becomes an
  order form: a quantity beside each available item, then a name, an email, an
  optional phone number and a note. It works without JavaScript, it says
  plainly above the button that nothing is paid there, and a sold-out item
  offers no quantity at all. What an order costs is read from the publish the
  visitor is looking at, never from what their browser sent, so a rewritten
  page cannot buy a loaf for a cent; an item you published without a price is
  ordered "price on request" and quoted by hand. Each order arrives in your
  inbox as an ordinary message listing what was asked for, with a reply that
  goes straight to the customer — nothing is ever sent out on your behalf. The
  same orders are listed for the site with the workflow you would expect (new,
  confirmed, fulfilled, cancelled, and back again if you press the wrong one),
  can be deleted when a customer asks you to erase their details, and export as
  a spreadsheet with one row per ordered item. Bots meet the same silent
  honeypot and per-visitor rate limit as the contact form.
- **Your website can now show what you actually sell.** A site holds a catalog
  — the dishes, rooms, services or courses you offer — in one currency, grouped
  into categories you name, with a price, a description and a picture per item.
  A catalog section puts it on a page, and can show one grouping alone, so
  starters and mains are two sections over one list. An item can be marked
  unavailable, and the page says so; an item marked hidden is not published at
  all — it never leaves the editor. Prices are written the way the page's
  language writes them (€ 12.50 in English, 12,50 € in French), always as whole
  cents and never as an approximation. If the list already lives in an alo Base
  table, one import copies it across — names, prices, descriptions, groupings
  and photos — and importing the same table again updates the rows it made
  rather than duplicating them; anything it cannot read unambiguously, like a
  price that could mean two different amounts, stops the import naming the row
  instead of guessing. Publishing freezes the catalog: what a visitor sees is
  exactly what was true when you published, until you publish again.
- **The templates are now something you can see before you choose.** New
  website shows the six shipped templates as cards saying who each one is for
  and which pages it brings, and one click on a card draws that template on the
  spot — the real page, rendered the way it would be published, with tabs for
  its other pages. Blank site sits first in the same row, so starting from
  nothing is still one click. You can walk the whole gallery with the arrow
  keys and never touch a mouse. Create makes the site with all its pages in one
  go and opens its Home page ready to edit; if the templates cannot be reached
  for any reason, the blank path still works and says so.
- **You can now start a website from a finished one, without describing
  anything to AI.** Six templates ship with the product — consultancy,
  restaurant or café, portfolio, association or charity, software or product,
  and local trade — each a small complete site of three pages with navigation,
  a footer and a contact form already wired up, on a colour theme chosen to
  suit it. You can look at any of them in full before you choose, exactly as it
  would be published. Creating one gives you a draft site with all its pages,
  ready to edit and yours from that moment; nothing goes live until you press
  publish. The templates deliberately contain no invented customer quotes, no
  invented team members and no prices — those are claims only you can make, so
  the pricing page arrives with the prices blank.
- **Your website now has a Results screen, and handing an enquiry to sales is a
  button in the contact inbox.** Results sits beside Analytics on the website
  page and reads the whole arc over 7, 30 or 90 days: how many people saw a
  contact form, started filling it in, sent it, how many of those enquiries were
  handed to your sales board, how many were won, and what has since been
  invoiced — with the same reading again per form. It says which numbers come
  from the visitor's browser and which were counted when a record was written,
  so you know a rate across that line is a floor rather than a measurement; it
  shows money per currency and never adds two currencies together; and it says
  in one sentence what the invoice figure counts. The handoff itself is one
  click on the enquiry you are already reading: pick the board and column, and
  the card is raised with the sender's name and address carried over, nothing
  retyped. An enquiry already handed over shows how its opportunity stands and
  offers to unlink it — which withdraws the claim and leaves the opportunity
  untouched. If CRM or Billing is not open for your account, the screen says so
  in its own words instead of showing zeros, and your contact inbox keeps
  working exactly as before.
- **Mail's controls no longer run off the edge of a narrow window, and its
  toolbars say what they are.** The row above a conversation and the formatting
  bar in compose now wrap onto a second line when the pane is too narrow for
  them, instead of pushing Delete and Categorize out of reach — and each is
  announced as a named set of controls rather than as a run of loose buttons.
  Twelve of those formatting buttons used to be read out as switches that were
  "not pressed", which was never true of any of them. Some of this looks
  different: Reply all and Forward are now outlined buttons beside Reply, a
  follow-up date is a filled pill rather than an outlined one and says
  "Overdue" in words as well as in red, and a calendar invitation sits on the
  same white as the message with a soft shadow instead of a grey panel.
- **An enquiry from your website can now become an opportunity on your sales
  board in one step, and you can see what the website is actually worth.** Open
  a message someone sent through a contact form and hand it to your pipeline:
  alo raises the card for you, carrying the sender's name and address so
  nothing is typed twice, and records where the enquiry came from. You can also
  point it at an opportunity you already have. One enquiry becomes at most one
  opportunity — clicking twice does not make a twin, and attaching a second,
  different card is refused with the reason. Your website's figures then read
  the whole way through: how many people saw a form, began filling it in, sent
  it, how many of those became opportunities, how many were won, and what has
  since been invoiced to them. Money is shown per currency and never converted,
  and the invoice figure says exactly what it counts — documents raised for the
  customer an enquiry became, after it became one — rather than claiming the
  page earned them. Unlinking is always available and changes nothing in CRM or
  Billing: it only withdraws the claim that the website brought it in. A
  collaborator invited to build a website still sees none of this; nor does
  anyone an administrator has switched CRM off for, and a bookkeeper can read
  the figures without being able to create or remove opportunities.
- **The Docs editor can now be used without a mouse, and says what it is doing
  to a screen reader.** The equation dialog and the insert-code dialog close on
  Escape and keep the keyboard inside them while they are open — before, Tab
  walked out onto the page behind and the only way out of the symbol palette
  was to find the × with a pointer. A table in a document is now announced by
  its number ("Table 2"), its columns are read as column headings, and the
  strip it scrolls in can be reached by keyboard. The row of insert controls
  above a paragraph is announced as one named group instead of two loose
  buttons, and the "Numbered" box under an equation now has its word properly
  attached, so clicking the word ticks the box. Some of this looks slightly
  different: the two dialogs are a little wider and sit on the same ivory panel
  as every other dialog in alo, and a broken cross-reference is now struck
  through in the warning red the rest of the product uses rather than in
  copper.
- **Your website now counts how many people reached a contact form, began
  filling it in, and actually sent it.** Each form on a published site is
  counted at those three moments, so you can see where interest turns into a
  message — and where it stops. The sent count is the honest one: it is
  recorded where your message is written, so a form left half-filled, a
  honeypot-caught bot, or a refused submission never counts as a conversion.
  Forms nobody has reached yet are listed too, with zeroes, because "nobody has
  found it" is worth knowing. As with every other number here, the three counts
  are kept separately and nothing links them: there is no visitor identity, no
  cookie, and no record of one person's path through your site — only totals
  per day, per form.

- **You can now see where visitors click and how far down they read, page by
  page.** The attention map sits one click from your website statistics: pick a
  page and a screen size, and the whole page is drawn in proportion — top to
  bottom, not one screenful — with the areas that were clicked most shaded
  darkest, plus a curve showing how many readers reached each tenth of the way
  down. Beside the picture the same finding is written out in words ("Centre,
  30–40% down — 42 clicks"), so it can be read without seeing the colours.
  Phones, tablets and computers are kept apart, because a page that reflows
  puts the same button somewhere else. A screen size with only a handful of
  clicks is deliberately not drawn: it says how many have been counted and how
  many are needed instead, because a map made from three clicks is a picture of
  three people. Nothing here is a recording — no cursor trail, no session
  replay, nothing that links two visits to the same person.

- **Your published pages now count where visitors click and how far down they
  read** — the raw material for the heatmap screen that follows. A click is
  counted as one square of a coarse grid over the page and a scroll as one
  tenth of it, kept separately for phones, tablets and desktops because a page
  reflows. As with every other number in your website statistics, nothing that
  could identify a reader is kept: no cookie, no session, no time of day, and
  no pointer position — two clicks by one visitor cannot be told apart from one
  click by two visitors. Pages your visitors' browsers name are capped at a
  hundred per day, so nobody can flood your statistics with pages you never
  published.

- **Your website statistics screen now shows everything it counts, grouped so
  it can be read at a glance.** Under the visit chart there are now three
  groups — how people found you (referrers, campaigns, countries), what they
  looked at (most-opened pages, the page each day started on, and the last one
  seen), and how they read it (a reading-time histogram, the websites visitors
  left for, and the kind of device). Each panel shows its top five with the
  rest one click away, and says in a line where its numbers come from, because
  a number read as something it is not is worse than no number: reading times
  are only reported by browsers that report them, so they never add up to your
  visit count, and a stored bucket like "1-3m" or "phone" is now written out in
  your language. A panel with nothing in it explains how something gets there —
  including the honest case of countries, which stay empty until your site is
  served through a network that resolves them, with every other figure on the
  screen unaffected.

- **Your website statistics now also say how long people read, and where they
  went next.** Published pages carry a small script that reports two things a
  server cannot see for itself: roughly how long the page stayed open, as a
  bucket ("under ten seconds", "one to three minutes") rather than a stopwatch
  reading, and the domain of any link a visitor followed off your site. It
  reports nothing else — no page, no identifier, no cookie, nothing that could
  be joined back to a person, and the exact number of seconds is thrown away
  before anything is stored. Visitors who block scripts still count as visits
  exactly as before; only these two numbers go unreported for them.

- **Your website statistics now answer where visitors came from and what they
  read first.** Alongside visits and pages, alo counts the campaign a link
  carried (`utm_campaign`), the country the connection was reported from, the
  kind of device — phone, tablet, desktop, or a crawler that is not a reader
  at all — and which page each day's visitors arrived on and left from. It is
  still counting, not watching: the rest of the link's parameters are thrown
  away before anything is stored, the address and the browser string are read
  once to derive a number and then dropped, and no visitor is followed from
  one day to the next. Still no cookies and still no banner. (Reading time and
  clicks to other websites need a small script on the page and are not part of
  this.)

- **You can now frame a photo where you can see it, instead of guessing.** The
  image fields in the website editor show the picture itself, with a frame you
  drag over it to choose what stays visible and a marker for the one thing that
  must never be cropped out — a face, a product. Both work with the keyboard as
  well as the mouse (arrow keys move, shift with the arrows resizes), and the
  exact percentages stay on screen and editable, so "the same crop as the other
  three photos" is a number you type rather than a drag you repeat. "Use the
  whole picture" undoes all of it in one click, replacing a picture starts its
  framing over, and your original file is never altered — the frame is a
  decision about the photo, not a change to it.

- **A picture that nobody has described now says so, and can be described in
  three ways.** Write the description yourself, mark the picture decorative
  when it carries no information (screen readers then skip it, and the field
  stops asking), or ask alo for a draft. The draft is a proposal you approve or
  discard, and it comes with a warning that means what it says: alo has not
  seen your photograph, it drafts from the words already in that section, so
  check it against the picture before approving. Nothing is written until you
  approve, and a suggestion longer than a sentence is refused rather than
  shown.

- **Photos on a published website now arrive at the size the visitor's screen
  actually needs.** Upload the picture your camera produced; a phone no longer
  downloads a 3000-pixel-wide version of it to show it 400 pixels wide. Each
  page offers the browser three sizes of every photo and says how wide the
  photo will be shown, and the browser takes the one it needs — usually a
  fraction of the bytes, with nothing to configure and nothing to prepare
  before uploading. A photo smaller than the size asked for is sent as it is,
  never enlarged, and the file you uploaded is kept whole and untouched. If a
  photo has been framed with a crop, the frame is what the website shows —
  including in the browsers and email clients that ignore the modern picture
  tags altogether, which used to be a hole this closes.

- **Putting a page behind a password is now something you can see and do.**
  Every page in the editor says who can open it, in those words: anyone on the
  internet, or only the people you handed the password to. Protecting a page
  takes a password and a click, and the screen is honest about what follows —
  visitors meet an unlock screen that shows nothing of the page, not even its
  title, so do not go looking for your page's name on it; the password opens
  the page for the rest of their day; and setting, changing or lifting it
  works at once, with no need to publish the website again. Nobody can read a
  password back to you afterwards, alo included, so the screen says so rather
  than letting you assume otherwise, and a "show" toggle lets you check what
  you typed before you save it. Changing the password tells you plainly that
  everyone who was let in with the old one will be asked again. Taking a
  password off asks a second time before it does it, because the page is
  public the moment it lands. The page list marks every protected page, and
  the editor's preview says out loud that visitors are asked for the password
  first, so a preview is never mistaken for what the internet sees. Visitors
  who get the password wrong now hear why when they move back to the field,
  not only when the screen first loads.

- **A page can now be published behind a password.** Some pages are meant for
  the internet and some are meant for the people you gave the address to: a
  dealer price list, a rehearsal programme, a page shared with one client. Put
  a password on any page and visitors see your own site's unlock screen instead
  of the page — in the page's own language, with nothing of the page showing
  through, not even its title. Get the password right and the page opens and
  stays open on that browser for the rest of the day. The rest of the website is
  untouched and stays public, and a protected page is kept out of the sitemap so
  search engines are not pointed at it. Change the password and everyone who was
  let in with the old one is asked again — which is what makes handing it out
  safe. Lift it and the page is public again on the next visit. Guessing gets
  nowhere: attempts from one visitor are limited, and the password itself is
  never stored — if you forget it, you set a new one.

- **A website can now publish itself at a moment you choose.** Beside the
  publish button, every website has a schedule: pick a date and time — the
  field already proposes tomorrow morning rather than waiting empty — and the
  site goes live by itself, whether or not you are at your desk. The moment is
  always shown in your own time, with your time zone named beside the picker,
  so the nine o'clock you pick is the nine o'clock you meant. Everything you
  save until then goes live with it. You can move the moment or call it off at
  any point, and nothing that is already online changes when you do. When the
  moment arrives, the screen says the site published itself — and if it could
  not (a website with no pages yet, for instance), it says so in plain words
  and keeps them until you have fixed it, instead of quietly doing nothing.

- **Every version of a website is kept, and an earlier one can go back
  online.** Publishing a website has always frozen exactly what visitors see.
  alo now keeps those versions as a history you can read — when each went
  live, who published it, how many pages and which languages it carried — and
  can say what changed between any two of them: the theme, the languages, the
  pages added, removed or edited, and the collections whose rows moved.
  Putting an earlier version back online publishes it again instead of
  rewriting the past: every version you had is still there, the one you put
  back is recorded as a copy of the version it came from, and the pages you
  are still working on are left exactly as you left them.

- **You can now see that history, and roll back with one click.** Every
  website has a Version history beside its publish button: the versions it has
  published listed by date, the one that is online marked as such, and the
  version you select shown exactly as visitors saw it — its own pages, its own
  theme, its own languages, on a phone or a desktop width. Before you act, the
  screen tells you what putting it back would change on the live site, and
  reminds you that the pages you are editing stay untouched. Putting it back
  online takes one click and no confirmation ceremony, because it is
  reversible: the result names the version that is now live, links to your
  address, and offers Undo, which puts back the version that was online
  before.

- **Meet now gives a clear, polished path through every call state.** A focused
  start-call hero and responsive live-meeting gallery replace the old utility
  list, with status, start time, and one-click joining visible on every card.
  Loading and failures
  no longer look like blank or empty screens, starting and joining failures say
  how to recover, and the device check has a visible way back. Join no longer
  stays disabled behind LiveKit's hidden name field, controls use alo's visual
  tokens, and one accessible Leave action remains visible throughout the call.
  Inside the room, meeting identity and live duration stay visible, controls
  sit in a compact dock, chat opens as a focused panel, and presenters see a
  calm sharing status rather than their own screen repeated forever.

- **People, in French and Dutch, and a promise about what it will never say.**
  alo HR is complete, and every word of it — the directory, asking for time off
  and answering it, the month that says who is away, the hiring board — reads in
  English, French and Dutch. A French contract is named the way the paper names
  it (*durée indéterminée*, not a translation of "permanent"), a Dutch
  self-employed colleague is a *zelfstandige* rather than a builder, and a
  candidate who did not get the job is told the process ended rather than that
  they were rejected. One rule is now enforced by a test in all three languages:
  **no screen in People ever says why somebody is away.** The absence view
  carries names and days, and translation is exactly where a reason would have
  crept back in.

- **The payroll file, for the bureau who actually runs your payroll.** Draw one
  period — a month, a fortnight, whatever you pay on — and alo hands you a CSV
  of what a payroll bureau needs: staff number, name, national insurance number,
  bank account, contract, hours a week, the pay on their terms, the leave they
  took inside that period, and what you owe them back in expenses and mileage
  that has already been approved. Holiday, sick leave and **unpaid** leave are
  three separate columns, because only one of them changes what somebody is
  paid, and a public holiday inside somebody's week off costs them nothing here
  exactly as it costs them nothing on their balance. alo calculates no wages: no
  gross-to-net, no tax, no contributions — that is your bureau's profession and
  it stays theirs. Pick the sheet your country's payroll software reads
  (German, Dutch, French conventions, or a neutral ISO one for everyone else)
  and the headings, the dates and the decimal comma come out the way that
  country writes them. People who invoice rather than being paid are left off;
  somebody who left mid-period is on it, with their last day; a claim in a
  currency you do not pay them in is counted in a column of its own rather than
  quietly added to a total. And because this one file carries everybody's pay
  and bank details on one page, drawing it is written down: who drew which
  period, in which sheet, and when — visible to HR, and to nobody else.
- **Invite somebody to work on one website, without opening the rest of your
  workspace.** Site owners can now invite a collaborator by email directly
  from the website, copy or refresh their one-time setup link, see whether
  they have joined, and revoke access in one click with an undo opportunity.
  The collaborator can edit and publish only that website; Mail, Drive,
  Billing, CRM, administration, and every unrelated website remain closed.

- **The letters your company writes, filled in for you.** HR can now write the
  letters this company is willing to put its name to — an employment
  confirmation, a letter for a landlord, a reference — once, in your own words
  and your own language, with `{{employee.name}}`-style blanks the editor lists
  for you. From then on, asking alo for one fills the blanks in and leaves the
  letter in your Drafts, addressed to nobody unless you said who, for you to
  read and send yourself. It never writes a letter of its own: ask for one
  nobody has written and it tells you which letters exist and stops there. The
  blanks it can fill are the ones the staff directory already shows everybody —
  what somebody is called, their job title, their team, the day they started —
  plus your company's own name and address. There is no blank for pay, a bank
  account, a date of birth or a home address, so no letter it fills can state
  one. A colleague you cannot look up is a colleague it will not write about;
  your own letter you can always ask for. And if the person is missing a fact
  the letter states — no job title on record yet — it says which fact and about
  whom, rather than handing you a letter with a gap in the middle of it.

- **Ask alo who is off.** "Who's away next week?" is now a question you can ask
  anywhere in the workspace: alo proposes the look-up, shows you the exact days
  it will read before you approve it, and answers with one line per colleague —
  the days counted, and the first and last of them. It reads the same team
  absence view everybody here already sees, so it can tell you nothing your
  calendar could not; it books nothing, decides nothing and tells nobody it
  looked. What it will never say is *why* somebody is away. Sickness, holiday
  and unpaid leave are indistinguishable to it on purpose, and somebody it does
  not name is not thereby at their desk — the card says both, so nobody reads
  more into an answer than is in it. Somebody off on Monday and again on Friday
  is two days off, never a week.

- **A candidate's CV, and the day they become a colleague.** You can now attach
  a CV to somebody's record from the browser: choose the file on the candidate
  form and it is filed in the HR area, where only HR can open it — replace it or
  take it off from the same place, and nothing is saved unless the file went up.
  Nothing reads it: no screening, no ranking, no score, in this release or any
  other. And when somebody takes the job, their card carries the one act that
  was missing — *Add them to the directory*. It opens with their name split into
  its two halves, the role, team and contract from the round they applied to,
  and asks for the day their terms begin, because every leave balance is counted
  from it. If the address is already a colleague's, the form says whose before
  you write a second record — and says it differently for somebody who has left,
  since a returning colleague is a real second record. It writes a record in
  People and nothing else: no login and no mailbox, which stay an
  administrator's to create.

- **Time off, asked for and answered in the workspace.** People now opens on
  *My leave*: what you have left on every kind of leave the company runs, with
  the working under the figure — this year's entitlement, what you have taken,
  what you already have booked and what is still waiting — so a balance is
  something you can check rather than something you have to trust. *Ask for time
  off* takes a first day, a last day and a sentence for whoever decides; you
  never type a number of days, because the days are worked out from your own
  working pattern and the company's public holidays. While you pick the dates,
  the form tells you who else is already off then. A request you have made can
  be taken back until somebody decides it, and leave that is booked can be given
  back until the day it starts. Managers and HR get the same screen one
  relationship wider — their team's, or everybody's — with Approve and Send back
  on the rows that are waiting, and a leave row in the approvals inbox now opens
  the decision here, beside its dates and its cost. Nobody is offered a decision
  on their own leave. A new *Who's away* tab draws the month as a calendar: who
  is out on which day, and the company's public holidays behind them. It says a
  name and a day and nothing else — never why somebody is away.

- **The company directory, and the org chart beside it.** People → Directory
  lists everybody who works here — their role, their team, how to reach them,
  who they report to and since when — and it is open to every member of the
  workspace, because looking a colleague up should not be a question you ask a
  person. The same screen draws the reporting tree: press *Where they sit* on
  anybody's row and the chart opens on them, in among the people they work with.
  One search box narrows both, matching names, roles, teams, addresses and
  numbers in any order; searching the chart keeps the managers above a match, so
  a narrowed tree never says the wrong thing about who somebody works for. Only
  the details a colleague may see are here — never an address, a birthday or a
  bank account. HR alone can add the people who have left, and they are marked
  as such rather than quietly listed. People now opens on the directory for
  anybody without a board or an inbox of their own.

- **One inbox for everything waiting on you.** Time off, expense claims and
  timesheet weeks used to wait in three different modules, which meant the one
  you opened least was the one that kept somebody waiting longest. They now
  arrive in a single list under People → Approvals, ordered by who has waited
  longest — the person, what they are asking for, the days or the amount, and
  the day they handed it in — with Approve and Send back on every row. Sending
  something back asks you for a sentence, because whoever gets it back is going
  to read it. A running count sits in the rail wherever you are, and shows
  nothing at all when nothing is waiting. Who may decide what has not changed by
  a word: leave is a manager's or HR's, claims are the bookkeeper's, weeks are
  the admin's, and each decision still goes to the module that holds the record.
  If one of the three cannot be reached, the list says so rather than quietly
  looking empty.
- **Invite a website editor without handing over the workplace.** A restricted
  site collaborator can now open, edit, and publish only the websites they
  were invited to. Other websites and the surrounding Mail, Drive, Calendar,
  Tasks, Contacts, Billing, CRM, and administration surfaces stay closed.
  Removing their final website grant removes the restricted role with it.

- **A People module, opening on the hiring board.** The workspace has a People
  entry of its own, and everybody has it: the screens most of us open here are
  our own. The first one built is Hiring, for the people who run it — the roles
  the company is hiring for in a picker, and the candidates for the chosen one
  on a board that works exactly like the task and deal boards: drag somebody
  from one column to the next and that is the whole act. The columns are the
  stages the server has, so the board and the record can never disagree about
  what a candidacy looks like. Opening a card shows what the application said,
  their CV to download, and the notes from the people who met them, with a stage
  picker beside them for anybody working without a mouse. The keep-until date is
  on the card and in the record, marked plainly once it has passed, with the
  button that erases the person's details, their notes and their CV — after
  asking, because that one cannot be undone. **Nothing on these screens scores,
  ranks or sorts a candidate**, and no column shows a machine's opinion of
  anybody, because there is none to show.

- **Hiring, kept honestly — and no machine ever reads a CV.** A company can
  write down the roles it is hiring for (the title, the team, where the work is,
  the terms on offer), publish one when the advertisement goes out, and close
  the round when it is over. Everybody who applies is recorded against the
  opening with what they sent — their name, how to reach them, where the
  application came from, and their CV, which is stored in the HR-only part of
  Drive where nobody without the HR role can open it or even learn it exists.
  Candidates move through seven stages, and a stage changes in exactly one way:
  a person moves them, and the trail records who and when. Correcting a
  telephone number can never move somebody by accident. Interview notes are
  written against the candidate with the name of whoever was in the room on
  them. **Nothing in alo scores, ranks, shortlists or otherwise evaluates an
  applicant — not even as a suggestion with a human decision after it.** That is
  a refusal, not a feature we have not got to yet: the EU AI Act treats
  automated filtering of job applications as high-risk, and there is no column
  in our database to put such a score in. Because an unsuccessful applicant's
  data has no employment-law retention behind it, every candidate carries a
  keep-until date — six months by default — and the record says plainly when
  that day has passed. Erasing them then removes the record, the notes and the
  CV, and it happens because somebody decided to: no timer deletes people here.

- **A new colleague's first week arrives as work, not as a wiki page.** A
  company can write down what it does when somebody joins or leaves — order the
  laptop five days before they start, countersign the contract the day before,
  walk them round on the first morning — saying for each step who does it (HR,
  their manager, whoever sets up accounts, or the person themselves) and how many
  days from their start or last day it falls. Running that checklist for somebody
  creates a real shared board: every step becomes a task, dated from their date
  and assigned to the person the role resolves to, so it turns up where its
  owner already looks instead of on a list somebody has to remember to read.
  Steps for a newcomer with no login yet, or a manager without an account, land
  on the desk of whoever drew the checklist, and the assignment is shown at the
  moment it is drawn rather than discovered later. Progress is counted from the
  cards themselves — tick one, the checklist moves — and the newcomer can see
  their own. Editing or deleting a template never disturbs a checklist somebody
  is working through. Creating the mailbox and granting the Spaces stay steps a
  person does deliberately: nothing here provisions an account.

- **Public holidays now count, so a week off over Christmas costs four days.**
  A company sees the public holidays of the country it invoices under from the
  first time it opens the leave screens — fifteen European calendars, each
  naming the law it comes from — and can choose which countries it observes and
  which one its leave arithmetic uses. A public holiday inside a leave request
  costs nobody a day: the request says how many minutes it saved, and the
  balance agrees. Movable feasts (Easter and the days that hang off it) are
  computed rather than listed, days the law added or removed appear and
  disappear on the right year, and a year we have not checked is refused by
  name instead of quietly answering "no holidays".

- **Build website collections from the Base tables you already use.** A new
  Collections workspace finds the Bases you can read, lets you match their
  columns to website cards, previews the exact rows the next publish will
  use, and makes reusable collections available in the page builder. You can
  disconnect a collection without deleting its Base or any of its rows.

- **Published Base collections stay exactly as visitors saw them.** Website
  owners can publish mapped Base rows as reusable cards with titles, paths,
  summaries, images, links, and dates. Later Base edits remain drafts until
  the site is published again, empty collections render a calm localized
  message, and invalid rows leave the existing live site untouched.

- **Turn an alo Base table into reusable website content safely.** Website
  owners can connect a table using stable columns for the title, path,
  summary, body, image, link, and publication date. Renaming a column does not
  break the connection, invalid field types are rejected before anything is
  changed, and disconnecting the collection leaves the original Base intact.

- **Ask for time off, and decide it.** People can now request leave against any
  of the company's policies, see what it costs before they ask — the working
  days it actually uses, at the hours they actually work — and take a request
  back while nobody has decided it. Their manager, or HR, approves or rejects it
  with a note; nobody approves their own leave. Approved leave that has not
  started can be cancelled and the balance comes straight back. The balance
  itself is shown with its whole working — granted, carried in, accrued, taken,
  booked, and what is still awaiting a decision — so a figure somebody disagrees
  with can be explained rather than asserted, and an approval that would take it
  below zero is refused by how much on a policy that does not allow it. Days
  another live request already covers are refused naming the dates, a weekend
  nobody works is not a request, and leave cannot be booked outside the terms
  somebody was employed on. Everybody in the company can see **who is away** on
  any day in a range — a name and a day, never the reason — which is what the
  Agenda will draw behind the week, and what the request form will show before
  you pick your dates. A sick policy a company records rather than approves
  lands as recorded, naming who wrote it down instead of pretending somebody
  decided.

- **alo HR learns how leave adds up.** A company can now set the leave it
  grants — annual, sick, unpaid, or anything else it gives time off for — with
  the entitlement for a full year, whether it lands on the first day or arrives
  a twelfth at a time, when the leave year begins, and how much may be carried
  into the next one. A company that sets nothing still gets one workable annual
  policy, from the statutory minimum of the country it invoices from, with the
  law that sets the figure named beside it: a starting point to edit, not legal
  advice. Everything is counted in **minutes**, not days, so a four-hour Friday
  costs a four-hour Friday and a move from five days to four does not quietly
  restate last spring's balance; the screens will show days, and the minutes
  behind them. No balance is ever stored: it is always recomputed from the
  policies, the working patterns and the absences that produced it, so a figure
  somebody disagrees with can be shown its working. Retiring a policy archives
  it rather than deleting it, because a balance is only explicable beside the
  policy that produced it. Requesting and approving leave follows next.

- **Translate a whole website, then decide.** Website owners can prepare one
  translation proposal for every page and blog post, compare the original and
  translated titles, paths, excerpts, SEO copy, and page sections, and approve
  the complete result only when it is ready. Preparing and reviewing changes
  nothing; approval writes the reviewed language atomically, and manual
  translation remains available when AI is not configured.

- **alo HR opens: the people you employ, and the papers you keep about them.**
  A company can now keep an employee record — who somebody is, how to reach
  them, who they report to, and the terms they are employed on — and it is
  readable by **two different doors on purpose**. Everybody in the workspace
  sees the directory and the org chart: a name, a job title, a team, and who
  reports to whom, because a company where you cannot find out who your
  colleague's manager is has its org chart in a filing cabinet. The home
  address, the date of birth, the bank details and the pay are HR's alone, and
  your own record is always yours to read in full. Contracts, amendments and
  letters are filed as real files in an **HR-only area of your Drive**: a
  colleague who is handed the link is told the file does not exist, and it never
  turns up in anybody's search. Archiving is the only removal — employment
  records must be kept for years after somebody leaves — and archiving a manager
  who still has reports is refused rather than quietly cutting a branch off the
  chart. Every change is in the audit trail: who did what, to whose record, and
  when, and never what the value was. The HR screens follow; this release is the
  module the API and the screens are both built on.

- **alo Inventory now speaks French and Dutch, from the shelf to the order.**
  The whole module reads in your own language: the catalog, what is on the
  shelves and the movement history behind a row, both order documents with the
  sentences that tell you exactly what placing or confirming one will do, the
  barcode scanner, and the two things you can ask alo about your stock. The
  words are a warehouse's — *en rayon*, *commande d'achat*, *démarque*; *op
  voorraad*, *inkooporder*, *derving* — and goods are **ingeslagen** and
  **uitgeslagen** in Dutch, because that is what a warehouse says. A word you
  already know from Billing stays that word: a draft invoice raised from a
  sales order is a *facture en brouillon* / *conceptfactuur* on both screens.
  Two deliberate details: a movement's reason and an adjustment's reason are
  written as **nouns** in French (*Réception*, *Casse*), because a participle
  would have to agree with goods the sentence never sees, while an order's
  state agrees with *la commande* as it should; and the refusals the server
  sends — a quantity larger than what is owing, a barcode whose check digit is
  wrong — are still in English in every language, as they are everywhere else
  in alo.

- **Ask alo what to reorder, and get the orders as drafts.** The assistant
  learns two things about your warehouse. Ask what is running low and it writes
  one **draft** purchase order per supplier for everything you are under your
  own minimum on — quantities from the minimums you set, prices from what that
  supplier already quotes you. Nothing is sent and no order number is drawn:
  each draft waits in Purchasing for you to check and send, the same as one you
  raised yourself. Something you are short of that nobody has quoted you for is
  never ordered from a supplier the assistant picked; it comes back on the list
  as "ordered nothing for", so you can see it and act on it. You can narrow a
  run to one supplier or one place. Ask instead how many of something you have
  left and it reads that one product back: what is on each shelf, what is on
  order, what is promised to customers, what that leaves you, and whether any
  shelf is under the minimum you set for it. That answer changes nothing, orders
  nothing and sets nothing aside — and it never guesses when you will run out.

- **Scan a barcode to find the thing.** The catalog and the stock list gain a
  **Scan** button. A handheld scanner needs nothing set up: it is a keyboard, so
  it types the code into the field and presses Enter for you, and the answer
  comes back as the product, how many you have, and which places they are in —
  no camera, no permission, and it works on the machine bolted to the packing
  bench. On a phone, where the browser can do it, the camera reads the code
  instead and stops as soon as it has one. A code the scanner misread is told
  apart from a product you do not stock: the first says the check digit does not
  match, so you scan again, and the second offers to add the item to your
  catalog with the barcode already filled in. Scanning finds *your* products
  only — two businesses can carry the same barcode and neither ever sees the
  other's.
- **Purchasing and sales orders, with the paperwork attached.** Inventory gains
  two tabs. On the purchasing side you raise a draft order for a supplier, fill
  it from your catalog — where picking an item copies **what you pay**, not what
  you charge — and place it when you are ready. Placing it is one act, and the
  button says all three parts of it before it happens: the order draws its
  number, it is frozen for good, and the covering letter with the printed order
  attached is written to **your Drafts**. Nothing is ever sent for you. When the
  goods turn up, "Book arrival" opens on exactly what is still outstanding, so
  the ordinary delivery is one click and a short one is a number you typed on
  purpose; booking it writes the stock movements and raises a draft bill for
  what came. The sales side mirrors it: draft, confirm — which draws the number
  and writes no message, because your customer already has your answer — then a
  consignment at a time out of the place you picked from. "Invoice what has
  gone" raises a **draft** invoice for the quantity the server says is still
  billable, so what the screen offers and what the button bills are the same
  number. Every order shows what has already moved against it, line by line,
  and every refusal — a quantity larger than what is owing, an edit to an order
  the supplier already holds — arrives in the server's own words with your work
  still on screen.
- **Inventory has screens: a catalog, and what is on the shelves.** A new
  Inventory tab in the workspace opens on your catalog — the same products you
  invoice from, seen as things rather than as prices: your own code, the barcode
  on the box, whether you keep a quantity of it at all, what you pay, what you
  charge, and how much you have across every place. Editing one opens the same
  product form Billing uses, now with the warehouse's fields on it and a picker
  for who you usually buy it from, so there is one product record and not two
  that drift apart. Beside it, Stock shows on-hand per place with a reference
  value at today's purchase prices — labelled as a reference figure, because it
  is not an accounting balance and alo will not pretend it is one. There is
  deliberately **no quantity to type**: every row opens its movement history
  instead, which says from where, to where, how many, why, and which document —
  the actual answer to "where did the other four go". Suppliers, customers and
  adjustments are hidden by default, since they are the other end of a movement
  rather than a shelf, and showing them says what it does to the total.
- **Apply the count, and the corrections are movements like any other.** When
  the sheet is worked down, applying the stocktake turns every difference into a
  stock correction — out of the shelf for what is missing, onto it for what you
  found — each one a movement with the sentence you wrote against the row and a
  link back to the count that produced it. So "where did the other four go" has
  the same answer it has for a delivery or a shipment, and no quantity is ever
  quietly overwritten. The correction is worked out against what is on the shelf
  **at the moment you apply**, not against what the sheet wrote down when you
  opened it: if a delivery went out while you were counting, that row is left
  alone and named in the result so you can re-count those few items — the
  shipment is never written over. Rows nobody counted are left alone too, and so
  are rows that turned out to be right. You are told exactly what was corrected
  and what was not, and why, rather than a number of successes. A count applies
  once and is then a record: no re-applying, no editing, no cancelling after the
  fact — and the shelf is immediately free to be counted again. A sheet nobody
  has counted cannot be applied at all; walking away from it is what `cancel` is
  for.
- **Count a shelf without stopping the warehouse.** Open a stocktake for one
  place and alo writes down what it believes is there — every product with stock
  on that shelf, with its SKU and barcode, ready for a phone and a scanner. Work
  down the sheet putting in what you actually find; each row shows what was
  expected, what you found, and the difference, worked out for you. Find
  something the sheet did not expect and scanning it simply adds a row, expected
  zero, which is the surplus you were counting to catch. A row nobody has got to
  yet stays **uncounted** rather than counting as zero, so an interrupted count
  never writes off the aisle nobody reached, and a mis-scan is undone by clearing
  the row rather than by typing what you hope was there. Because business does
  not stop for a count, every row also shows what is on that shelf **now**: if a
  delivery went out at the far end of the room while you were counting, the row
  says so and asks you to re-count those few items — nothing is silently written
  over. One count per place at a time, so two people cannot produce two truths;
  a count you walk away from keeps its sheet, leaves stock untouched, and frees
  the place to be counted again. Counting moves nothing by itself; applying the
  count does, and that is the entry above.
- **Tell alo how much to keep, and it tells you what to buy.** Set a minimum
  and a target for a product at a place — "keep at least four blue chairs in the
  main warehouse, and buy back up to twenty" — and the shortage report answers
  the question a buyer actually asks on a Monday morning: what is short, by how
  much, how much to order, and from whom. It counts three things, and shows you
  all three rather than one number you have to trust: what is on the shelf, what
  is already **on order** and has not arrived, and what is **promised** to
  customers on confirmed orders and has not gone out. So ordering thirty this
  morning takes the item off the list this afternoon instead of nagging you
  about it every day until the lorry comes, and promising seven to a customer
  puts it back on. The quantity to buy closes the gap to your target and is
  never below the smallest quantity your supplier will sell; the estimate beside
  it is at the price **they** quote, with their lead time, so you know both what
  it costs and when it lands. A product no one has quoted for is still listed —
  it just has nobody named to buy it from. A rule can be parked out of season
  without losing the numbers you worked out, and a shelf you are emptying on
  purpose, or a product you have stopped selling, quietly drops off the list.
  The whole report downloads as a spreadsheet.
- **Invoice a sales order for what actually went out.** One button on the order
  raises a **draft** invoice in Billing carrying what has been delivered and not
  yet billed — each line at the quantity that shipped and the price you quoted
  on the order, plus the delivery charge or discount you agreed, billed once.
  Nothing is invoiced before it ships: charging for goods that may never leave
  is a VAT statement made on a hope. So a part delivery bills the part, and when
  the rest goes out the same button raises a **second** draft for the new
  quantity only — never a repeat of the first. Pressing it with nothing new
  shipped raises nothing and says which of the two reasons it is: nothing has
  gone out yet, or everything that has is already on an invoice. An order still
  in draft is refused; an order you gave up on part-way through still bills what
  the customer received, which is what closing the remainder always meant. The
  invoice is billing's from the moment it exists — inventory never issues it,
  never sends it, and never touches it again — and if you throw the draft away,
  or void it after issuing, what it carried becomes billable again in the same
  instant. Crediting it does not: the goods stay billed against the document the
  credit note corrects. The order shows, per line, what has gone out, what is
  already billed and what is left to bill, and lists every invoice it raised
  with its number and where it has got to.
- **Sales orders: what a customer asked you for, and shipping it.** You can now
  take an order — who it is for, what they want, at the price you quoted — as a
  draft you edit freely, and confirm it when you say yes. Confirming gives it
  its number, `SO-2026-00001`, stamps it with today and freezes it, so your copy
  and theirs stay the same document. It deliberately moves no stock and reserves
  nothing: an order is a promise, and goods move when they are picked. Shipping
  is one act — say where you picked from, and how much of each line went if it
  was only part of it — and it takes the stock off that shelf, moves the order
  to partly or fully delivered, and stores the **delivery note** that travels in
  the box: numbered within its order (`SO-2026-00001/D1`), quantities only, no
  prices, because the person unpacking it is not the person who negotiated it.
  If the whole order goes, you say nothing about lines at all. **You cannot ship
  what you have not got**: a shelf that is short refuses the whole delivery and
  says what is actually there, which is the point of counting stock by movements
  rather than by a number somebody typed. More than was ordered is refused the
  same way, naming the line, so an over-delivery is recorded deliberately as an
  adjustment with a reason. An order nobody confirmed, or one cancelled or
  already complete, ships nothing. Giving up on an order that has partly gone
  out closes the remainder for good and has to be asked for in as many words —
  and un-ships nothing, because what has left has left. Every order and every
  consignment is on the record, with who booked it and the movements it wrote.
- **Booking a delivery does the paperwork with it.** When goods arrive against a
  purchase order, say where you put them — and, if only part of the lorry turned
  up, how much of each line came. In one act the stock goes onto the shelf, the
  order becomes partly or fully received, and a **draft bill** for exactly what
  arrived is waiting in Bills, with your supplier's address and payment terms
  and the prices you agreed. Nothing is approved and nothing is paid: the bill
  sits undecided until a person says so, and when the supplier's own invoice
  arrives it comes in beside it as their document. If the whole order arrived,
  you say nothing about lines at all. More than you ordered is refused, saying
  which line, what was ordered and what has already come, so an over-delivery is
  recorded deliberately as an adjustment with a reason instead of quietly
  inflating the shelf. An order that has not been sent, or that has been
  cancelled or already completed, takes no delivery — and every arrival is on
  the record, with who booked it and the movement it wrote.
- **Translating a site is now a visible, manual workflow.** Each site's
  languages, progress, and missing pages are shown together; opening a missing
  translation clearly shows the source language and offers one click to copy
  it before editing. Titles, addresses, search descriptions, and page sections
  are then edited and previewed in the chosen language, while publish readiness
  shows exactly what remains. Nothing requires AI and fallback text can no
  longer be mistaken for a finished translation.
- **Sending a purchase order is now one act.** Placing an order gives it its
  number — `PO-2026-00001`, drawn the same unbreakable way an invoice number is
  — stamps it with today, freezes it, and writes the covering email to your
  supplier's own address with the printed order attached, all together. Nothing
  is sent behind your back: the letter lands in your Drafts for you to read,
  change and send yourself, and it quotes the order's own total and the day you
  want the goods. If the letter cannot be written, nothing happens at all — the
  order is still a draft and its number is still free, so you can never end up
  with an order marked sent that nobody was ever told about. An order already
  out refuses to be sent twice, in words that say to raise another one instead.
  The order itself is now paper too: `print` gives you a clean A4 page under
  your own letterhead and `pdf` the file, both in English, French or Dutch,
  with your supplier where a customer stands on an invoice, the day you expect
  delivery where a due date stands — and deliberately none of your bank
  details, because an order is not a document anybody pays you on.

- **Purchase orders: what you asked a supplier for, written down.** You can now
  draft an order — who it is with, what you want from them, at the price they
  quote, in their currency, with your own reference and the day you expect it —
  and alo adds it up for you: net, VAT per rate and gross, computed on the
  server so the figure on the screen is the figure in the record. A line can
  point at something in your catalog, which is how the goods will find their
  way onto the shelf when they arrive; a line that points at nothing is a
  charge in words — freight, packaging, the discount they gave you — and that
  one may be negative. While it is a draft it is yours to change or throw away.
  If you stop expecting the goods you cancel it instead of deleting it, and the
  decision is kept with the day you made it. Everything a purchase order does
  is in your audit trail, and none of it can reach another company's suppliers,
  products or orders.

- **A published alo Site can now speak each language at its own clean address.**
  Publishing freezes every exact translation alongside the site's language
  choices, so later draft edits cannot leak onto the live site. Visitors get
  visible one-click language links; search engines get matching canonical,
  `hreflang`, `x-default`, sitemap, and feed metadata. The default language
  keeps the shortest address, translated pages use a language prefix, and alo
  never invents a page in a language that has not actually been written.

- **You can now correct the shelf — and alo makes you say why.** Two things a
  warehouse does by hand have doors of their own: moving goods between your own
  places, and admitting the shelf disagrees with the system. A correction picks
  from a short list of real answers — damaged, lost, expired, internal use,
  sample, found, corrected — and you may add a sentence. Neither is an edit:
  both are movements, kept for good, next to who made them and when, so the
  question "who took forty out of stock, and why" has an answer instead of a
  guess. Every one of these acts also lands in the audit trail. What alo
  refuses is as deliberate: you cannot book goods as arriving from a supplier
  or leaving to a customer by hand — those follow a purchase or a sales order,
  which is what keeps a delivery note, a bill and a payment able to agree. A
  correction that names no place to correct against, a transfer wearing the
  word "adjustment", and a place you have archived being filled up again are
  all refused in words that say what to do instead. You can also add your own
  warehouses, vans and shop floors, rename the ones alo gave you, and archive a
  place that is being emptied — movements *out* of it keep working, which is
  the whole point of emptying it. An accountant can read all of it and change
  none of it.

- **alo now counts stock the way it keeps books: by recording what moved.**
  There is no quantity you can type over. A warehouse, a shop floor, a van —
  each is a place, and every arrival, sale, transfer and correction is a
  movement from one place to another, kept for good. What you have on hand is
  what those movements add up to, so "we should have four" always comes with
  "and here is where the other forty went". Nothing here is set up first: the
  moment you open Inventory, alo gives you one place to keep things — named in
  your own language, renameable, and yours to delete — plus the counterparts it
  needs to say where goods came from and went to. Two refusals are deliberate.
  Stock never goes below zero: shipping four hundred when four hundred are not
  there is refused, naming the item, the place, what is available and what was
  asked for, because a negative number on a shelf means the data is already
  wrong and everything reported from it will be too. And a product that has
  moved cannot quietly stop being a stocked item — archive it instead, and its
  history stays readable. Two people shipping the last one at the same instant
  get exactly one sale and one clear refusal, never two. Today this reaches you
  through the API; the stock screens and the adjust-and-transfer flow follow.

- **The people you buy from are now a list of their own.** alo keeps your
  suppliers the way it keeps your customers — name, address, VAT id, the
  account you pay into, what they charge you and how long they take — and
  deliberately keeps them *apart* from your customers, because the one mistake
  a single flagged list makes is putting a supplier in the customer picker of
  an invoice. Each supplier carries their own price list for your products:
  their article code, their price, the smallest quantity they will sell, and a
  delivery time that can differ per product — enough for alo to say "forty
  from Hoffmann at €3.15 each, here in nine days" rather than "you are short
  forty". Saving a quote twice leaves one quote, so a slow connection cannot
  duplicate a price. A VAT id or an IBAN with a typo in it is refused the
  moment you type it, by its own check digits, and the refusal tells you the
  rule without repeating the number back. A supplier is archived, never
  deleted: an order from two years ago still names them. A product can also
  say who you usually buy it from, which is what the reordering work will
  start from. Today this reaches you through the API; the supplier screens
  follow.

- **Your price list now knows what is on the shelf.** A product can carry the
  code you call it by, the barcode on its box, what you *pay* for it as well as
  what you charge, a photo from your Drive, and one plain fact: whether it is a
  thing with a quantity or a service. Nothing changed for what you already
  sell — every existing product stays a service, and every field is optional,
  so a consultancy never sees a warehouse. Two refusals are on purpose: a
  barcode is checked against its own check digit, so a mistyped or misread code
  is caught while you are typing it rather than when the wrong item ships; and
  a code you already use on another product is refused by name. That
  uniqueness is yours alone — another company selling the same book is no
  business of your catalogue, and never blocks you. Today this reaches you
  through the API; the catalogue screens follow.

- **alo Finance now speaks French and Dutch, from the receipt to the return.**
  The whole module reads in your own language: the claim you fill in, the queue
  an approver works through, the bank import and the screen where you say what
  each payment settled, your chart of accounts, the four reports, and the three
  things you can ask alo about the books. The words are the ones on the
  documents these screens produce — *note de frais*, *plan comptable*,
  *déclaration de TVA*; *declaratie*, *rekeningschema*, *btw-aangifte* — and
  Dutch says **afletteren** for the bank work, because that is what a
  bookkeeper says. A word you already know from Billing stays that word: an
  invoice that is *Émise* on an invoice list is *Émise* on a bank screen. Two
  deliberate exceptions: the **column headings in a downloaded CSV stay
  English**, because your accountant's own tools read them and a spreadsheet is
  a contract rather than a sentence; and your chart of accounts is written in
  your language once, when it is created, and is yours to rename from then on.

- **Claim what you drove, at the rate your company sets.** Finance now keeps a
  per-kilometre rate table for your company and turns a trip into an expense
  claim from it: the distance, the day, the rate that applied, and the amount
  worked out for you rather than typed in. An admin sets the rates; a rate is
  never guessed from a country. Today it is reachable from the API; the screen
  follows.

- **Hand alo a receipt and check what it read.** Put a receipt in your Drive,
  point Finance at it, and alo comes back with what it made of it — the
  merchant, the date, the total, the VAT and the rate — as fields **for you to
  confirm**, never as a claim it already filed. It writes nothing: the claim is
  created afterwards from whatever you actually agreed to. Anything it could not
  read comes back empty rather than filled with a guess, and the VAT is what the
  paper printed rather than the total times a rate, so a receipt showing a rate
  and no tax gives you a rate and no tax. Today it is reachable from the API and
  reads a receipt by its own text; the button in the claim form, and a model
  behind the reader, both follow.

- **Ask alo what VAT you owe, and to look over your books.** Two questions alo
  can now answer from the books themselves rather than from a search. Ask for
  last quarter's VAT and you get the figures your journal carries — tax charged
  on sales rate by rate, tax paid on purchases, and the difference, said plainly
  as what you owe or what you are owed back. They are the same figures the VAT
  report on the Reports tab shows, because they are read the same way; they are
  **figures for a return, not a return**, and nothing is filed anywhere. Both
  days have to be stated, so a figure never appears under a period nobody asked
  for. Ask alo to check your books and it reads the period's entries and names
  what is worth a second look: the same amount booked twice to the same customer
  or supplier inside a week, an amount unlike anything else on its account, a
  monthly cost that skipped a month. Every one comes with **the entries behind
  it** — the day, the line, the amount — because a flag you cannot check is an
  accusation. There is no score, no risk rating and nothing about any person:
  these are questions about entries. Nothing is changed, nothing is marked as
  reviewed, and if a period holds more entries than one check can read, it says
  so instead of reporting all clear. Both answers are for admins and the
  accountant, the same people who can open the reports.

- **Ask alo to sort out your expenses — and answer each suggestion yourself.**
  Say "categorise my expenses" and alo goes through your own claims that have no
  category yet and suggests one for each, taken from the categories *you* have
  already used for that merchant, with how many earlier claims back it. Every
  suggestion waits for you: accept it or say no, one claim at a time, right on
  the card. Nothing is classified, booked, reported or put on a VAT return until
  you accept — a suggestion is kept apart from the category you chose, so a
  guess can never end up in your books. A merchant you have never classified
  gets no guess at all, and the claims it left out are listed with the reason.
  Say no once and it will not suggest that claim again, though you can still
  pick a category yourself.

- **See where your money actually stands, and keep the chart of accounts
  yourself.** Finance has two new tabs. **Accounts** is your chart of accounts,
  grouped by what each account holds and showing what it moved over any period
  you choose. You do not have to build it: the first time you open it, alo
  writes a neutral chart in your own language and says so — and every line of it
  is yours to rename, renumber, retire or replace. Renumbering is safe at any
  time, because invoices, payments and expense claims find their account by the
  job it does ("what customers owe us") and never by its number, so your
  accountant's numbering breaks nothing. An account we created cannot be deleted
  and says why; one that carries entries is history rather than a preference, and
  is retired instead. **Reports** draws the four folds of the books a business is
  actually asked for — profit and loss with the same period a year earlier beside
  it, the balance sheet on any day, who owes what by how overdue it is (both
  directions), and the VAT-return figures from your books rather than from your
  invoices. Each one is a table with the period picker and the CSV button your
  accountant will ask for, and every figure on screen is the one the server
  computed: nothing here is added up in your browser. A balance sheet that does
  not balance says so out loud instead of printing a figure that looks fine.

- **Fixed: a tab in Finance now goes where it says it goes.** Clicking through
  the module's tabs could build up an address that never arrived anywhere.

- **Start a website at its real address, then get straight to the page.** Name
  a website and alo suggests its editable address while showing the complete
  result and availability together. Pasting a full address works too, and a
  refusal now says exactly what the server found. Create opens the new Home
  page in its editor instead of leaving you at a page list; its first visible
  action starts a Hero section in one click.

- **Improve website copy as a proposal you can inspect.** Rewrite, shorten,
  expand or retone the eligible words in any saved section, compare the exact
  current and proposed copy, then approve or discard it. Whole-page changes
  likewise show a real Before and After preview and do not alter the stored
  page until approval.

- **Build websites throughout in French or Dutch.** The complete Sites
  workspace — creation, pages, every section type, themes, previews and
  publishing — now has native French and Dutch labels instead of falling back
  to English halfway through a task.

- **Bring in a month from your bank, and see what each payment settled.** Import
  a statement — a CAMT.053 or MT940 download, or any CSV export — and alo reads
  it and shows you what it made of it *before* anything is stored: which column
  it took for the date and the amount, how it read the numbers, the first
  transactions as it understood them. Correct anything it got wrong from the
  file's own headers and look again. If one row cannot be read, nothing is
  imported and you are told which row and why, rather than being left with a
  refusal you cannot act on. Every transaction then lands in one pile to work
  through: alo says what it thinks each one settled and, in plain words, why —
  your invoice number was quoted, the amount is exactly what is owed, this payer
  has been matched this way before. One click confirms it, which records the
  payment and moves the books; the undo sits beside it. For the ones it cannot
  guess, pick the invoice yourself from the ones still waiting for money, or set
  the transaction aside with the reason the next person will need. Importing
  statements and settling lines are the bookkeeper's — an owner, or the
  accountant you appointed — and are now refused to everybody else.

- **Claim what you spent, in a screen you did not have to be taught.** Finance
  is now a place in alo rather than an API: a tab of your own claims — the day,
  the merchant, the total on the receipt and whose money paid — with a form that
  asks for those and nothing else. Type the amount the way you write numbers,
  comma or point; leave the currency empty and it is your workspace's own. A
  claim is yours to correct until you hand it in, and handing it in freezes it;
  if you need it back, take it back. If it comes back refused, the sentence the
  approver wrote is on the row, and the claim is yours to fix and hand in again.
  Whoever decides claims — an owner, or the accountant you appointed — gets a
  second tab with two queues: what is waiting for a decision, and what the
  company has approved and still owes somebody out of their own pocket, cleared
  one payment at a time with the day the money actually moved. Nobody else sees
  that tab, and nobody else's claims: yours are yours.

- **Give your accountant the books, and only the books.** You can now mark
  someone in your organization as your accountant. They get what the job needs:
  every finance report, the expense claims waiting to be decided, and the power
  to close a period once it is filed — plus your invoices, quotes and deals to
  read, because a posting only makes sense next to the document behind it. They
  get nothing else. They cannot change an invoice or a deal, cannot open the
  admin console, cannot add users or set what you pay per kilometre, and have no
  way into anyone's mail or files: an accountant is a person with their own
  mailbox and nothing shared into it. Turn it on beside their name in Users &
  mailboxes, and turn it off the same way the day the engagement ends.

- **The figures for your VAT return, straight out of your books.** For any
  period you name, alo now shows the tax you charged — rate by rate, with the
  turnover each rate was charged on — the tax you paid on purchases and may
  reclaim, and the one number the form asks for: what is owed, or, if you paid
  out more than you took in, what is owed back to you. It is your journal added
  up rather than a second tally kept alongside it, so it agrees with your
  invoices by construction; anything booked without a rate on it is shown
  separately instead of being quietly folded into one, so you can see at a
  glance whether everything is where it should be. Every amount is in the
  currency you keep books in, each document converted at the rate frozen on it
  the day it was raised, so re-running last quarter still answers last quarter.
  Take it away as a CSV your accountant can open. These are figures for a
  return, not a return: filing still goes through your national portal.

- **See who owes you, and how long they have owed it.** The aged listing now
  stands beside the balance sheet: every customer with something open, each of
  their unpaid invoices, and how late it is — not yet due, up to a month, up to
  two, up to three, and past three months. Ask it for any day and it answers as
  of that day, counting the documents that had been issued by then and only the
  money that had arrived. Credit notes sit in the customer's own group and
  subtract, part payments leave only the remainder standing, and a settled
  invoice is off the list entirely. The same report reads the other way round —
  `side=payable` — over the supplier bills you have approved, so you can see what
  is about to be chased out of you as clearly as what you are chasing. A document
  raised in another currency shows what it says in its own and is added to the
  bands at the rate frozen on it when it was issued; anything that cannot be
  converted honestly is left out of the totals and counted, so a figure is never
  part guesswork. Take it away as a CSV your accountant can open, per document
  and per customer.

- **See what you own and what you owe, on any day you name.** The balance sheet
  now stands beside the profit and loss: your bank and what customers still owe
  you on one side, suppliers and the VAT you have collected on the other, the
  owners' stake, and the profit or loss nobody has closed into it yet. Pick any
  date — a year end, a month end, the day before a big payment landed — and it
  answers as of that day, everything up to it counted. It states in plain
  figures whether it balances, so you never have to take that on trust, and
  every line carries what the account is for as well as what it is called. Take
  it away as a CSV your accountant can open.

- **See what you earned and what you spent, beside last time.** alo now answers
  the first of the four accounts reports: a profit and loss for any period you
  name, income and cost account by account, with the period of the same length
  before it in the next column — the quarter before a quarter, the year before a
  year. Every figure is your books added up rather than a second tally kept
  alongside them, so it agrees with the ledger by construction, and it is in the
  currency you keep the books in whatever your customers were billed in. Take it
  away as a CSV your accountant can open, totals and result included.

- **Close the books on a quarter, and have them stay closed.** Define your
  fiscal periods, and close one when it has been reported and filed: from then
  on, nothing can be booked into it — not a late receipt, not a payment, not a
  correction to something that was already there — so the figures you filed on
  Monday are still the figures on Friday. When something genuinely has to be
  changed, an admin reopens the period, says why, and closes it again; the
  reason stays on the period and the whole round trip is in your audit trail.
  Refusals say exactly what is in the way — which period is closed, and when
  somebody closed it — rather than failing halfway through issuing a document.

- **Say what a bank line really was, and change your mind.** You can now tick a
  transfer off against any invoice yourself — including one nobody could have
  guessed, one paid years late, and one paid in part, which leaves the rest
  still owed and still chased. Got it wrong? Undo it: the payment goes, the
  invoice is owed again, and your books carry a visible correction rather than a
  hole where an entry used to be. Lines that are nobody's invoice — a bank
  charge, a transfer between your own accounts — can be set aside with a reason,
  which stays on the line for whoever reads the statement next, and taken back
  just as easily.

- **Recognise the payer who wrote no reference at all.** Bank lines that quote
  none of your numbers are now ranked against what your customers still owe,
  each with the reason in plain words — "the amount is exactly what this invoice
  owes, and it is the only one that owes it", "the name on the transfer is this
  customer's", "half of the invoice they named". A resemblance on its own is
  never offered: something has to identify the document, and you still confirm
  every match yourself. When a payer's bank spells them differently from your
  customer record, tell alo once — "money from this account is theirs" — and
  every future statement recognises them, with the rule shown and deletable.

- **Tick off a bank statement against the invoices it paid.** alo now reads the
  reference a customer wrote on their transfer, finds the invoice it names, and
  — when the money matches what that invoice still owes, to the cent, in the
  same currency — offers it as a match. Nothing is ever ticked off for you: you
  confirm, and only then does alo record the payment, mark the invoice settled
  and move your books. A transfer a cent short, one quoting no number, or one
  paying an invoice a colleague already settled is left for you to decide about,
  with the reason in plain words.

- **Follow busy blogs and browse their full history.** Website journals now
  keep article lists quick with clear Previous and Next pages, and every blog
  includes a standards-based RSS feed for readers and feed apps.

- **Give every live website a real journal.** Visitors can now browse a clean
  card-based Blog page, open a published article with its picture and alo Docs
  content, and move between the journal and homepage. Draft articles remain
  private.

- **Publish richer alo Docs as safe website articles.** Pictures, code examples
  and equations now carry into a website article without loading the editor.
  Unsafe embedded markup stays readable text instead of running in a visitor's
  browser.

- **Write a website article once, in alo Docs, and keep its structure.** Blog
  rendering now turns document paragraphs, headings, quotes, links, bulleted
  and numbered lists, nested lists, and checklists into clean semantic web
  content. Bold, italic, underline and strikethrough text carry across too.
- **Import a bank statement, whichever file your bank gave you.** Upload a
  CAMT.053, an MT940 or a plain spreadsheet export and alo reads which one it
  is. A spreadsheet's columns are matched by their headings in English, German,
  French and Dutch, and you correct the guess before anything is imported.
  Nothing is imported halfway: a row alo cannot read names its line and the
  reason, and the whole file waits until it is fixed. The same month downloaded
  twice, in two different formats, is still imported once.

- **Two questions alo asks instead of guessing.** `03/04/2026` is the third of
  April in Paris and the fourth of March in New York; `1.234` is a thousand in
  Berlin and one and a bit in London. Where the file itself settles the answer,
  alo reads it; where nothing in the file does, it asks you rather than being
  wrong by a month or by a factor of a thousand.

- **Turn an alo document into a website article without copying its words.**
  A website can now keep draft or published blog metadata around a document in
  Drive: its address, title, excerpt, cover image and publication time. The
  document remains the single source of truth, and removing an article never
  removes the document it came from.

- **Take website enquiries into any spreadsheet in one click.** The visible
  Export CSV button in a site's Submissions inbox downloads every visitor
  message with its form, sender, received time and handled state. Commas and
  multiline messages stay intact, and text is made safe before Excel or
  another spreadsheet opens it.

- **Read and resolve website enquiries without leaving your site.** Every
  website now has a visible Submissions inbox beside its pages. Open a visitor
  message, see which contact form it came through, reply from the sender's
  address, and mark it handled in one click; reopen it just as quickly if more
  work is needed. A new inbox explains how to receive its first message instead
  of showing an empty table.

- **Projects now speaks French and Dutch, down to the letters on a duration.**
  Switch the language and the whole tab follows: the engagement list, the week
  you fill in, the plan, the approvals a manager works through, the
  profitability report, and every dialog that asks before something is
  deleted. The words on your own hours change with it — a French timesheet
  reads *7 h 30 min* and a Dutch one *7 u 30 min*, never the English *7h 30m*
  — and so do the assistant's cards: the hours it suggests, the status it
  reports on a project, and its reason for leaving a meeting out of a
  timesheet it drafted. Nothing about the numbers themselves changed: they are
  the server's, in all three languages.

- **Fill in a forgotten week from your calendar.** Ask the assistant for
  *"my timesheet on Aurora from the 27th to the 31st"* and it suggests one entry
  per meeting in your own Agenda over those days — the meeting's title as the
  note, its length as the duration, to the minute. Every one of them is a
  **suggestion**: they are in no total and no submitted week until you accept
  them, one click each, in My week — where discarding one is a click too, and
  neither asks you to confirm. The project is the one you named and never a
  meeting's title, so a call with one client can't be charged to another. What
  it leaves out is part of the answer: all-day entries (a day marked *Leave* is
  not an hour worked), anything already in your timesheet from a previous ask,
  meetings in a week you have already submitted, and anything with no length —
  each listed with the reason. Ask twice and nothing is doubled, not even the
  Monday stand-up you have every week. Meetings that overlap are all suggested
  and flagged as overlapping: which of two double-booked calls was the work is
  yours to say, not ours to guess.

- **Ask alo about a project, or tell it what you worked on.** Two new things the
  assistant can do. *"How is the Hansen relaunch going?"* answers with the
  project's own figures — hours logged and how much of them are billable, the
  budget and how much of it is used, the milestones with what is next and what is
  late, and how many tasks are open or past their date. It reads and changes
  nothing. *"Log two hours on Hansen for yesterday, drafting the brief"* puts a
  **suggested** entry in your timesheet: it is in no total, no submitted week and
  on no invoice until you accept it there, and accepting is what prices it at the
  engagement's rate. Both name the project the way you do — a name that matches
  two of your projects is a question back to you, never a guess — and a duration
  is always whole minutes, so nothing is rounded on the way in.

- **Your website's contact form now reaches your inbox.** When a visitor
  writes through a form on your published site, the message arrives in your
  own alo mailbox moments later — the visitor's words as the body, their
  address on Reply-To, so answering them is one ordinary reply. Nothing is
  ever sent on your behalf: the notification is internal delivery only, and
  the submission also stays listed with the site either way.

- **A contact form is ready the moment you add it to a page.** There is no
  second setup step and no hidden form record to create: add the section,
  publish, and a visitor can write to you. The section keeps its real form
  link when the editor saves it, and a form from another site or workspace
  can never be attached by mistake.

- **Start the next project from the last one.** Any shared project board can be
  marked a **template**, and starting a project from one copies the shape of the
  work: the cards with their columns, order, priorities, labels and checklists,
  the milestones, and which task belongs to which milestone. Give it a name and
  a start date and the whole plan lands there — the template's first milestone
  becomes your start date and every other date keeps its spacing, so a shape
  built once is re-dated for every client that follows. What it never copies is
  somebody else's work: no assignees, comments, history, attachments, hours, and
  no finished cards — a new project does not open with work already done. The
  template's customer stays behind too, because a template is the shape of an
  engagement and not the client; its currency, rate and budgets come along when
  you name the new customer, so a retainer priced once stays priced. The
  template is a project like any other, so you edit it on the board you already
  know, and a copy is its own board from the moment it exists.

- **A plan on the board you already have.** Projects has a **Plan** tab:
  milestones — a name and a date, "Design signed off, 30 September" — drawn
  along a timeline, with the project's own tasks grouped under them. The tasks
  are the same cards Tasks shows, not copies, so one closed on the board is
  closed here in the same instant; putting one into the plan is a single choice
  because a task sits under one milestone and no more. A milestone is
  **reached when you say so** and never because its last task closed — the
  count beside it tells you how the work is going, and the button stays yours,
  because "every task done" is not the sentence "the client accepted it". One
  that has slipped past its date says *late*, judged by the server, so a laptop
  with a wrong clock cannot quietly clear it. Deleting a milestone deletes a
  date and nothing else: every task under it stays exactly where it was on the
  board.

- **What an engagement is worth, against what it was budgeted for.** Projects
  has a **Reports** tab: pick two dates and it shows every client project you
  can see — the hours worked in that period, how many were chargeable, what
  they are worth, how much of that is already on an invoice and how much is
  still to invoice, with a bar for the budget beside it. The bar counts
  everything up to the end of the period, not just the period, because that is
  what a budget is spent by; the hours above it are the period's, and the
  screen says so rather than leaving you to work out which is which. Hours
  nobody has priced are counted and named ("45m not priced") instead of being
  quietly valued at nothing, so the gap is somewhere you can see it. Work
  priced in two currencies is shown as two lines and never added together.
  Every figure is the server's, computed from the very rows an invoice would
  carry, so what this screen says and what the document says are the same
  number. There is a **Download CSV** beside it for a spreadsheet or an
  accountant, carrying the same figures and no customer or personal data at
  all. It says *value*, never *margin*: what an hour costs to deliver is a
  question the ledger will answer, and it is not being guessed at here.

- **Projects is now a place you can open.** A new tab in the workspace shows
  every project you can see as *client work*: who it is worked for, what an
  hour on it is worth, how many hours have gone into it, and a bar saying how
  much of the agreed budget that is — turning red, not stopping at full, when
  the work has gone past it, because an overrun is the one thing you open the
  screen to find. A project here is the same board Tasks already shows; what
  this adds is the client, the rate and the budget beside it, and a project
  with none of those is listed as internal rather than hidden. Saying who a
  project is worked for is one form and one save, and undoing it — "make
  internal" — leaves every hour exactly where it was: what goes is only the
  claim that somebody can be billed for them. The hours a project has cost are
  the project's, not anyone's in particular: they are shown to everybody who
  can see the project, and there is nowhere on the screen, or in the API
  behind it, that says who worked which of them.

- **A timesheet you fill in, and a timer you can see from anywhere.** *My week*
  is a plain grid — projects down the side, the seven days across the top —
  where you write straight into a day and the totals come back from the server.
  Type the duration however you say it: `90`, `1:30`, `1,5` and `2h` all mean
  what you would expect. Every entry of the week is listed underneath with its
  note, so a day with two sittings on the same job keeps both. When the week is
  done you submit it from the same screen and it goes still; take it back while
  nobody has decided, or read the reason if it comes back. Managers get an
  **Approvals** tab — theirs alone, and simply not there for anybody else —
  listing every week handed in, oldest first, with whose it is and what it adds
  up to, to approve or send back with a sentence the person will read. And the
  running timer now lives in the rail, visible from your inbox, your calendar
  and everywhere else: what is running, how long it has been running, and one
  button to stop it. It shows nothing at all when no clock is going.

- **Approved hours can now become an invoice.** Pick a customer and the
  workspace shows you every hour that is ready to be charged for them —
  approved, chargeable, not already on a document — grouped the way the invoice
  will group it: one line per project per rate, with what each is worth and what
  the whole lot comes to, in each currency separately because euros are never
  quietly added to dollars. Hours nobody has priced are shown too, with no
  amount beside them, so you can price the engagement rather than discover later
  that the work went out at nothing. Choose what to bill, state the VAT rate, and
  you get a **draft** invoice — never an issued one, never a sent one: you read
  it, edit it and issue it yourself, exactly as with any other invoice. The hours
  you billed are stamped with that document and leave the list, so nobody can
  charge for them twice; delete the draft, or void the invoice once issued, and
  they come straight back to be billed again. Crediting an invoice deliberately
  does not release them — a correction of a document is not permission to charge
  for the work a second time. Everything travels or nothing does: a half-billed
  selection cannot happen, and anything refused says how many hours it was about
  and why. The word *hour* on the finished document is written in the language
  the invoice is raised in.

- **A week can now be handed in, and an approver can answer it.** When your
  week is finished you submit it, and from that moment its hours hold still —
  nothing in it can be added, changed, moved in or out, or deleted while
  somebody is looking at it. Change your mind before anyone has decided and you
  can take the week straight back. An administrator sees every submitted week
  in one queue, oldest first, with whose it is and what it adds up to, and
  either approves it or sends it back with a reason. A returned week unlocks
  immediately, which is the whole point of returning it: you fix the day that
  was wrong and submit again. An approval can be undone too — unless the hours
  have already gone onto an invoice, in which case you are told how many and on
  which document, because the way back from a document a customer has read is
  to credit it, not to quietly edit the hours underneath it. Weeks are Mondays
  to Sundays, stated as such; asking for a week by any other day is refused
  rather than rounded to a week you did not mean. Every submit, decision and
  reopening is written into the record's own history.

- **Your time is now something the workspace can count.** A clock you start
  from a project board runs until you stop it, and stopping is what writes the
  hour down — with the task you were on, what you were doing and the day it
  belongs to, in your own zone rather than the server's. Start a second clock
  while one is running and nothing is decided behind your back: you are told
  which one is going and you choose. A clock left running overnight stops at a
  full day and says how long it really ran, so a forgotten Friday timer becomes
  a day plus a note rather than a twenty-two-hour line on a client's invoice.
  Hours worked away from the clock are typed in the same way, corrected while
  they are still yours to correct, and read back a week at a time with the
  totals underneath. What is chargeable and what it is chargeable at come from
  the engagement itself, taken as a snapshot when the hour is written, so
  repricing the work tomorrow never rewrites what you did today. **Your hours
  are yours**: a colleague on the same board cannot see them, and every change
  to one is recorded in the record's own history.

- **Insights now speaks French and Dutch, down to the labels on an axis.**
  Switch the language and the whole tab follows: your boards and the charts on
  them, the picker of ready-made questions, the box you type a question into,
  the empty screens and every confirmation before something is removed. The
  charts themselves change language too — the months and quarters along an
  axis, the age brackets on your overdue money, the column headings in the
  table version of every chart — so a French quarter reads *T1 2026* and a
  Dutch one *K1 2026*, rather than an English abbreviation on a European
  report. The **Business overview** a workspace is handed on its first visit is
  written in the language of whoever opened it, and it carries the same names
  as the ready-made charts it was built from, so pinning one you already have
  does not quietly produce a differently-named twin. Renaming any of them
  changes nothing but the name.

- **Contact forms on live sites now actually send.** A visitor pressing Send on
  a published site's contact form has their message stored with the site it was
  written to — nothing more: in keeping with the no-tracking promise, only the
  name, email and message they typed are kept, never their address or browser.
  Junk is turned away at the door — a hidden trap field silently swallows bots,
  a sender who floods is politely asked to wait a few minutes, and a form that
  does not exist (or whose site is not live) reveals nothing about what does.
  The message landing in your inbox and the submissions screen arrive in the
  next slices.

- **Ask Insights for a chart in your own words.** A new **Ask for a chart**
  button on any board: type "how much did we invoice each month this year?" and
  the assistant proposes a chart — which you then *look at*, drawn from your own
  invoices and deals, before anything is added to the board. Pin it and it
  becomes an ordinary tile, captioned with your own question; discard it and
  nothing was ever stored. The assistant chooses from the same closed list of
  datasets, measures and breakdowns the ready-made charts use — it never writes
  a query, and never sees another company's data — so a question it cannot chart
  comes back as a plain "no chart could be built from that" rather than a chart
  that looks right and is not. Workspaces with no AI model configured see the
  button say so and lose nothing else.

- **Insights now opens on your business, with nothing to set up.** The first
  time anyone in your company opens Insights, a **Business overview** board is
  already there and already answering: what you are owed, what you won this
  month, revenue month by month, how overdue your money is, the pipeline by
  stage, VAT by quarter and your win rate — live figures from your own invoices
  and deals, without a single click, a builder or a setup form. It is an
  ordinary board from the moment it exists: rename it, widen a chart, take one
  off, and if you delete the board it stays deleted. It is written once, in the
  language you were using when you opened Insights, and the captions are yours
  to rename after that. Beside it, an **Add a chart** picker offers ten
  ready-made questions across Billing and Sales — top customers, payments
  received, deals won by month among them — that pin to any board in one click.

- **Insights: your numbers now have a screen.** A new tab in the workspace,
  beside Billing and Sales, where the figures your business already produces are
  charts you can look at: boards you name and arrange, each holding tiles that
  show one answer as a single figure, a bar, a line, a pie or a plain table.
  Every number on a board is the server's own — the same arithmetic the printed
  invoice and the VAT return use — so a chart and a tax return cannot disagree
  about a cent, and money that could not honestly be restated into one currency
  is shown as what it is: two figures, side by side, never one invented total.
  Charts draw in your language, down to the months on an axis, and every chart
  is also present as a table for a screen reader. Widen a tile, move it, rename
  it or take it off the board; a chart pinned by a newer version of alo says so
  instead of leaving a hole.

- **Your website can now keep what visitors send it.** Under the surface, every
  site gained a place for contact forms and their submissions: each message a
  visitor writes — name, email and what they had to say — is stored with the
  site it was sent to, waiting to be read and marked as dealt with. In keeping
  with the no-tracking promise of alo Sites, a submission stores only what the
  visitor typed — never their IP address or browser fingerprint; there are no
  columns for them. The public submit button and the inbox notification arrive
  in the next slices; nothing on a live site changes yet.

- **alo CRM now speaks French and Dutch — and so does the history on every
  record.** Switch the language and Sales follows: the board and its columns,
  the deal drawer, the log, the next steps, the linked conversations, the
  win/loss report and every confirmation in between. So do the parts of
  Billing that arrived with it — recurring invoices, from the cadence you pick
  to the sentence that tells you how a monthly arrangement anchored to the 31st
  behaves in February — and the **History** on an invoice, a quote or a deal,
  where each line reads as the language's own way of naming what happened. The
  assistant's proposal cards are translated too, so approving a deal it
  suggested no longer means reading English to do it. Your first board is
  already in your language — a French tenant is handed *Ventes* with *Gagné*
  and *Perdu*, a Dutch one *Verkoop* with *Gewonnen* and *Verloren* — and
  renaming a column changes nothing but its name. The one thing still English
  everywhere is a refusal from the server, the same gap Billing named.

- **Every invoice, quote and deal now remembers who changed it.** Each record in
  Billing and CRM carries a **History**: created, edited, issued, paid,
  credited, moved, linked — each line naming the colleague who did it and when.
  It fills itself in as people work; there is nothing to switch on and nothing
  anyone can write into it by hand. Only things that actually happened are
  recorded — a change the system refused, or a page somebody merely looked at,
  leaves no line — and the history never keeps a copy of what a field said
  before, so it answers "who and when" without becoming a second copy of your
  data. Your tenant's history is yours alone: another organisation asking about
  one of your records is told the same nothing as somebody asking about a record
  that never existed. Administrators keep the tenant-wide log they already had
  under Admin → Audit log, which now shows these business events alongside
  administrative ones.

- **alo Billing: pay your suppliers in one upload.** The bills you have approved
  can now be handed to your bank as one **SEPA credit-transfer file** — the same
  `pain.001` file your bank's own upload form expects — instead of being typed
  into online banking one payment at a time. Pick the bills, pick the day the
  bank should execute, and alo writes the instruction: your account, each
  supplier's account, each amount, and each supplier's own invoice number as the
  reference, so their ledger recognises the payment when it lands. Names your
  bank cannot spell are folded on the way in (`Müller & Söhne` becomes
  `Muller + Sohne`) rather than refused, and euro-only, positive-only,
  approved-only are checked before you download anything. **A bill goes into one
  payment run**: the second attempt at the same one is refused, and tells you
  which run it was already in — you can still repeat it deliberately, for the
  file the bank never executed. Ask your bank which version they want: alo writes
  `pain.001.001.03` by default and `pain.001.001.09` on request. Handing the file
  over is not the same as being paid, and alo does not pretend otherwise: it
  records that you instructed the payment, and the money is reconciled when the
  bank says it moved.

- **alo Billing: bill it once, bill it every month.** Anything you charge on a
  rhythm — a retainer, a subscription, a hosting fee — can now bill itself.
  Open the invoice you already send, choose **Repeat this invoice**, pick weekly,
  monthly, quarterly or yearly and the day it starts on, and alo takes it from
  there: each time it comes due, a **draft** appears in your invoices with the
  same lines, the same prices and the same terms. Nothing is ever issued for
  you — you read it, change what you like, and issue it yourself. Every draft a
  schedule raised is marked **Recurring** in the list, so you always know why it
  is there. The new **Recurring** tab shows what you bill on a rhythm, what each
  one is worth, when the next one falls and how many it has raised; pause one
  and it stops without losing its place, resume it and it picks up the months it
  owed. A monthly arrangement anchored to the 31st bills on the last day of
  February and on the 31st again in March, which is what "monthly" is supposed
  to mean. alo checks every hour on its own — the **Raise what is due** button is
  only for when you would rather not wait — and a month can never be billed
  twice, however often it runs.

- **Ask alo can work your pipeline.** The assistant now proposes three CRM
  actions for you to approve: raise a **deal** (from what you said, or from the
  email you are reading — approving then links that conversation to the new
  deal), **move a deal** to another column, which is also how you win or lose
  one, and write a **follow-up email** to a deal's contact. As everywhere else,
  it only ever proposes: you see the card first, and nothing happens until you
  approve it. The follow-up lands in your **Drafts** and is never sent for you;
  the recipient is the deal's own contact, never a name the assistant chose. It
  finds a deal by its title, and when two of yours share a word it asks which
  one rather than guessing.

- **alo CRM: bring your lead list in.** Upload the CSV your spreadsheet
  exported and alo tells you what it would do **before** it does anything:
  which columns it read as what, what each row is worth in real money, which
  rows it will skip because you already deal with those people, and which rows
  it cannot import and why — by line number, so you can find them. Then import,
  and either every lead lands or none does; there is no half-imported file to
  untangle. It reads what European spreadsheets actually write: semicolons,
  tabs, `1.234,56` and `1,234.56` alike, accented names from Excel on Windows —
  and it refuses `1.234` rather than guess whether you meant a thousand or one
  and a bit. Duplicates are matched on the address, then on the company's own
  email domain (never Gmail's), and skipped rather than merged. Today it is
  reachable from the API; the import screen follows.

- **alo Sites: press the button, go live.** Publishing is now in the editor.
  A draft site shows exactly where it will go live — `your-name.alosites.com`
  — and one click puts the current pages and theme on the air, frozen as
  published, so you can keep editing without touching the live site until you
  press **Publish changes**. A live site shows its address as a link you can
  open, and **Take offline** (with an are-you-sure second click) brings it
  back down whenever you want. The new-site form now previews the full
  address while you type it.

- **alo Sites: your look, your logo.** Every site now has a theme you pick in
  the editor: seven designed color-and-type looks, each checked for readable
  contrast, applied to the whole site with one click. Upload your logo and it
  replaces the site name in the navigation bar; upload a favicon and browsers
  show it on the tab. The pictures you add — logo, favicon, and every section
  image — are stored in your Drive, show up immediately in the draft preview,
  and are served on your published site. Image fields in the page editor now
  take a direct upload too, so adding a photo is a file picker, not an ID.

- **alo CRM: win it, and bill it.** A won deal no longer stops at a card.
  Open it and raise a **quote** or an **invoice**: alo creates the customer from
  the lead if there is not one yet, copies the deal across as a line at its
  stored value, and lands a **draft** in Billing for you to check — nothing is
  issued, nothing is sent, and no invoice number is used up. It asks for the one
  thing a deal cannot answer, the VAT rate, rather than guessing a rate onto
  your invoice. Losing one is easier too: the reason is now a picker — Price,
  Timing, Chose a competitor — that fills a field you can still type over.
  And there is a **Report** tab: what is open on the board by stage, what you
  won and lost between any two days, your win rate, and a **Download CSV** for
  the spreadsheet your Monday meeting runs on. Each currency is reported on its
  own, never converted into a forecast nobody can reconcile.

- **alo CRM: your pipeline, on screen.** Sales is now a module you can open:
  a board of your deals, one column per stage, where you drag a card from
  Qualified to Proposal the same way you move a task. Moving one into your
  "Lost" column asks why before it does anything — the reason goes on the deal,
  so your win/loss report has something to say. Click a card and the deal opens
  beside the board: what it is worth, where it stands, the log of what was said,
  the next steps (real tasks, in the list you already open every morning), and
  the email conversations it belongs to — with **Open in Mail** for the ones in
  your own mailbox, and the name of the colleague who linked the rest. Ask for
  suggestions and CRM proposes conversations from your own recent mail, telling
  you which address matched; nothing is attached until you say so. There is a
  list view too, for the questions a board cannot answer — your open deals by
  value, everything won this quarter — and its filters are answered by the
  server, so what you count and what you see always agree. A link to a deal is
  a link you can send: it opens the same deal for whoever you send it to.

- **Sheets open faster and files get readable web addresses.** Opening a sheet
  now loads the editor only when it is needed, shows the file name while it
  opens, and keeps that file at a readable address that survives a browser
  refresh.

- **alo Sites: see the page as you build it.** The page editor now shows a
  live preview beside the section stack — the real page, rendered by the
  same engine that will serve it to the public, so what you see is what
  publishing will produce. It refreshes the moment a change is saved, and a
  toggle switches the pane between desktop and phone width so you can check
  both before anyone else sees either. It is a preview of your draft: only
  you can see it, and nothing goes live until you publish.

- **alo CRM: what was said, and what happens next.** A deal now keeps a log —
  notes, calls and meetings, each dated when it *happened* rather than when you
  typed it up, so a call you write up in the evening still reads in the right
  place. Everyone in your company can read a deal's log and add to it; an entry
  is written once and can be removed only by the colleague who wrote it, because
  a record of what was said is not something anybody else gets to edit. And the
  next step on a deal is a **real task**, not a CRM-only reminder: it lands in
  your own task list (or a team project you choose), shows up in the deal with
  the date it is due, and is the same task you tick off tomorrow morning — one
  to-do list, not two. Assign it to a colleague and they see it on the deal too.
  Tidying a deal away removes its log and leaves everybody's tasks alone.

- **alo CRM: a deal can name the conversation it came from.** Every deal now
  carries the email threads it belongs to, and CRM will suggest them for you —
  it reads *your own* recent mail, matches it against the deal's contact and
  customer addresses, and proposes the conversations that look right, telling you
  which address matched and why. Nothing is attached until you say so: a
  suggestion is a proposal, never an automatic link. Mail stays in mail — the
  link holds no message, no addresses and no copy of anything, just a pointer, so
  deleting the link changes nothing about your mailbox and deleting a deal takes
  its pointers with it and leaves the mail alone. Colleagues see that a
  conversation is attached, what it is called and who attached it; opening it
  still needs the conversation to be in their own mailbox, so linking a deal
  never hands anybody a key to somebody else's mail. And conversations from
  personal addresses at Gmail, Outlook, GMX and the like are only ever proposed
  on an exact address match, so a customer who mails from a personal account
  never drags your private mail into a record the whole company reads.

- **alo CRM has an API: the boards your deals move across, and the deals
  themselves.** The first time anybody opens CRM your company is handed a
  working funnel — a *Sales* board with New, Qualified, Proposal, Won and Lost —
  named in the language of whoever opened it, and yours to rename from that
  moment on. What a column *means* is a flag on it, not its name, so you can
  call the winning column "Signed" or "Gagné" without breaking a single figure.
  Deals are raised in a column, dragged across the board, and every move is kept:
  a deal's history says where it went, when, and who moved it. Winning or losing
  one is a move rather than a checkbox — a lost deal must say why — and a deal
  can be reopened without the year's win rate being rewritten behind you. Moving
  a card and editing it are deliberately different actions, so a stale edit form
  can never win a deal by accident. Retiring a board or a column is an archive,
  refused while live work is still standing in it, so nothing quietly disappears.
  The screens for all of this come next; the API is here.

- **alo Billing now speaks French and Dutch — including the documents your
  customers receive.** Switch the language and the whole module follows:
  every screen, every button, every confirmation. So does the paperwork
  itself. An invoice, credit note or quote prints in your language, with the
  amounts written the way that language writes them — `1.234.567,89` in
  Dutch, `1 234 567,89` in French — and the covering email and the payment
  reminder are written in the same language as the document they carry, so a
  French invoice can never arrive under an English note. A language we do not
  ship yet prints in English rather than refusing, and country codes stay
  codes: `DE` reads the same in every member state. The one thing still in
  English everywhere is a refusal from the server ("the check digit of this
  DE VAT id does not match") — that is next.

- **alo Billing: chase a late invoice in one click.** The invoice list has an
  **Overdue** view, and every late row now carries a **Remind** button. It
  writes the letter for you — what the invoice is worth, when it was payable,
  how many days late it is, what has already been received and what is still
  owed — and leaves it in your **Drafts**. Nothing is emailed: you read it,
  change a word, and send it yourself. Clicking twice writes two drafts and
  changes nothing about the invoice, and the figures in the letter are the
  invoice's own, so the two can never disagree. A settled or cancelled invoice,
  a draft, or a credit note is not offered the button, and a customer with no
  email address says so rather than failing quietly.

- **Ask alo can now do the billing paperwork — and never more than paperwork.**
  Three new things you can ask for in plain language: *"invoice Kunde for 7.5
  hours of consulting and 120 km travel"* raises a **draft** invoice, pricing
  each line from your price list when you name a product; *"the customer
  accepted QUO-2026-00001"* closes that quote and raises the draft invoice for
  it, with the offer's own prices; *"remind them about INV-2026-00042"* writes a
  reminder — how late it is, what is still owed, what has already arrived — into
  your **Drafts** for you to read and send. As always, alo shows you what it
  will do and waits for you to approve; and as with every billing action, none
  of these issues a document, assigns a number, or sends any mail. If it cannot
  tell which customer or product you meant, it says which ones it found and asks
  — it never picks one. A settled, cancelled or unissued invoice, or a credit
  note, is refused with the reason instead of being chased.

- **alo Billing: a supplier's e-invoice can now be read in, not just written
  out.** Upload the XML file a supplier sent — Factur-X (CII) or XRechnung
  (UBL) — and it becomes a **bill**: their company and address, their number
  and dates, their lines and their totals, waiting for you to approve or reject
  it. Nothing is guessed at: if the document does not add up, or carries a
  figure alo cannot hold exactly, the upload is refused and says which business
  term or which rule of the standard is wrong — so you can tell the supplier
  what to fix instead of discovering it at the year end. The same invoice is
  never booked twice, whoever forwards it. A decision is final, and a bill
  nobody has decided on can be deleted if the wrong file was uploaded. Reading
  the XML **inside** a supplier's PDF is not there yet; upload the XML file
  itself (the PDF's attachment) and you are told so plainly if you try.

- **alo Sites: the visual page editor.** Open a page and build it from
  sections: pick a block from a gallery of twelve — hero, features, pricing,
  FAQ, contact form and more, each with a small preview sketch — fill in its
  content, and it is on the page. Drag sections to rearrange them (or use the
  arrow buttons), edit any section to change its words, and delete with a
  confirming second click. Every change is saved the moment you make it, and
  the stack always shows exactly what is stored; a refusal names the broken
  rule in plain words and keeps everything you typed.

- **alo Billing: the same invoice as an XRechnung, for German public
  administration.** An issued invoice can now be downloaded as XRechnung 3.0
  (UBL 2.1) as well as Factur-X — the file a German authority and a Peppol
  access point expect. It is the *same* document as the PDF and the Factur-X
  XML, so nothing can disagree about a figure. Because XRechnung asks for more
  than the European standard does, the download refuses when something is
  missing and says exactly what: a telephone number in your billing details, a
  post code, or the customer reference (for a public body, the Leitweg-ID) —
  each named by the rule a receiving system would quote back at you, so you
  learn it from us rather than from a rejection weeks later. Your billing
  details are read live, so filling in a telephone number fixes every document
  at once; a reference belongs to the document and has to be on it before you
  issue it.

- **alo Sites: your websites now live in the workspace.** The rail has a new
  **Websites** area: every site you have, with its address and whether it is
  live. Create one by picking a name and claiming an address — the form checks
  availability as you type and tells you in plain words when an address is
  free, taken, or not allowed. Open a site to see its pages with the home page
  marked, and add a page with a title and path — the first page you add is
  offered as the home page. Every rule is the server's: a refusal always
  names the exact rule that was broken. The visual page editor is next.

- **alo Sites: build and publish your website through the workspace API.**
  Everything a site is made of can now be managed while signed in: create a
  site by claiming a free subdomain (with a live taken/free check), add and
  arrange pages, stack typed sections on each page (add, edit, reorder,
  remove), pick a theme, and publish — or unpublish — with one call. Every
  input is checked before it lands: unsafe links, unknown section types,
  reserved names, and duplicate slugs are refused with a message naming the
  exact rule, and publishing tells you what is missing (a page, a home page)
  instead of failing silently. Nothing you edit reaches the public site until
  you publish. This is the API the visual editor ships on next.

- **alo Sites: published sites are now served on the web.** The new
  `alo-sites` service answers for `<your-subdomain>.<sites domain>`: it looks
  up the site by the address it was asked for and serves exactly what you
  published — the frozen pages, the theme's stylesheet, and a styled
  "page not found" in your site's own look. Edits after publishing change
  nothing on the public site until you publish again, and a republish shows up
  on the very next request. Visitors' browsers are told to re-check pages
  every minute and get a compact "not modified" answer when nothing changed.
  One site's address can never show another site's content — that isolation
  is a tested guarantee, not a hope. (Self-hosted deployments: run the new
  `alo-sites` container with `SITES_DOMAIN` and wildcard DNS pointed at it;
  nothing else changes.)

- **alo Billing: your invoices are now e-invoices (Factur-X).** Every issued
  invoice and credit note is also a **machine-readable European e-invoice** —
  EN 16931, the model the French and German mandates are written against. You
  do not have to do anything to get one: the PDF you download or email now
  **carries the e-invoice inside it**, so your customer's bookkeeping system
  can read the figures straight off the file a person is looking at, and the
  two can never disagree or arrive separately. Customers whose systems want the
  data on its own can be sent the XML alone.
  If your billing details are not complete enough for the standard — no country,
  no VAT identifier, no address — the e-invoice tells you **which rule** is
  unmet (`BR-09`, `BR-S-02`) instead of producing a document your customer's
  gateway would reject weeks later. Your invoice still prints and still sends
  in the meantime. Drafts and cancelled documents have no e-invoice, which is
  what the standard says: a credit note is how an issued invoice is corrected,
  and it carries an e-invoice of its own.
  (Not yet PDF/A-3, the archival flavour Factur-X also asks for: that needs an
  embedded font we have to license first.)

- **alo Billing: invoice in another currency, and keep your books in yours.**
  Your billing details now name the **currency you keep books in** — euro unless
  you say otherwise — and you can invoice a customer in any currency alongside
  it. Under that setting you keep the **exchange rates**: paste the European
  Central Bank's published rate file (the daily one, or its whole history), or
  type a single rate by hand. Nothing is fetched on your behalf, so the rates
  your books are converted at are a file you chose, and a file with one bad value
  changes nothing at all rather than importing half of itself.
  When you issue a foreign-currency invoice, the rate of that day is **frozen on
  the document** — the day's published rate, or the last one published before it,
  which is what the VAT rules ask for. The document then prints its VAT a second
  time in your own currency with the rate beside it, which is what makes it a
  valid invoice outside the euro; the same figures appear on screen and in the
  PDF. A credit note converts at the rate of the invoice it corrects, so the two
  cancel exactly in your books. An invoice in a currency you have no rate for is
  **not** issued: it says so and stays a draft, rather than being numbered at a
  rate nobody published.
  The **VAT report** now ends with the whole period in your accounting currency —
  every document at the rate frozen on it — which is the figure a return is
  copied from. Each currency still gets its own table above it, and if anything
  in the period could not be converted the report says how many documents that
  is, on screen and in the CSV, instead of quietly leaving them out.

- **alo Billing: the VAT figures for a period, in one screen.** Billing has a
  new **VAT report** tab: pick two dates — or click **This quarter** or **Last
  quarter** — and see what you billed at each VAT rate between them, with the
  tax on it and the totals underneath. It counts the documents that actually
  stand: issued and paid invoices, dated by the day they were **issued**, with
  credit notes subtracted; drafts and cancelled documents are not in it, because
  they charged nobody anything. The tax shown is the sum of the tax on your
  documents, not the rate re-applied to a total — so the figures agree with the
  invoices your customers are holding, to the cent. Amounts in different
  currencies are reported separately and never added together. **Download CSV**
  saves the same figures as a file for your accountant; it carries rates,
  amounts and counts, and names no customer.

- **alo Billing: record what your customers have actually paid.** An issued
  invoice now has a **Payments** section: enter what arrived, the day your bank
  shows it, how it came and the reference on the statement line. Part payments
  are the ordinary case — a customer settling a large bill in instalments — so
  the invoice shows what has been received and what is **still owed** after each
  one, and only flips to **Settled** when the whole amount is in. Nothing about
  that state is typed by anyone: it is worked out from the payments themselves,
  so what the invoice says and what the ledger under it holds can never
  disagree. A payment keyed wrongly is **removed** and entered again, which puts
  the invoice back to owed. The invoice list gains a **Still owed** column and
  an **Overdue** view — issued, past its date, not yet settled — judged against
  the server's date, so no clock but ours decides who is late. Two refusals
  worth knowing: an invoice that money has been received against can no longer
  be **voided** (correct it with a credit note, so both movements stay
  visible), and a credit note takes no payments at all, because it is money
  owed the other way.

- **alo Billing: email an invoice to your customer, without leaving the
  invoice.** An issued invoice can now be sent to the customer it names: alo
  writes the email for you — addressed to that customer, with the PDF attached
  and a short note stating the number, the total and when it is payable — and
  puts it in your **Drafts**. It does not send it. You open it, change a word
  if you want to, and send it yourself like any other message, so nothing ever
  leaves your mailbox without you seeing it first. A draft invoice cannot be
  sent (it has no number yet — issue it first), nor can a voided one, and a
  customer with no email address is told so plainly. Sending the same invoice
  twice simply writes a second draft: nothing about the invoice changes.

- **alo Billing: an invoice as a PDF you can send.** Any invoice can now be
  fetched as a **PDF file** — the same document as the Print view, laid out for
  A4, with the pages numbered when there is more than one so nobody can mislay
  half a bill. It is produced entirely by alo, on your own server: no browser,
  no external service, and nothing about your customers leaves the machine to
  make it. The file is named after the document inside it
  (`Invoice-INV-2026-00001.pdf`), it downloads rather than opening in the
  browser, and it is never cached. Emailing it to the customer arrives next.
  One limitation, until the next release: the PDF is set in a font that covers
  Western Europe, so Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Baltic, Greek and
  Cyrillic letters are simplified to their nearest Latin form on the **PDF**
  (`Łukasz` prints as `Lukasz`). The Print view and everything on screen are
  unaffected.

- **alo Billing: the document your customer actually receives.** Every invoice,
  credit note and quote now has a **Print** button that puts a proper A4
  document in front of you: your name and address at the top, theirs beside it,
  the lines, the VAT broken out per rate, the total, and — on an invoice — what
  is payable by when and the account it goes to. A draft prints as a **draft**
  and carries no number, because it has none; a voided invoice prints as
  **void**; a credit note is titled as one and names the invoice it corrects,
  and neither a credit note nor a quote shows your bank details, since nothing
  is payable on them. The page is the same one the PDF and the emailed
  attachment will be made from, so what you see is what your customer gets.
  Fill in **Your details** first (a new tab in Billing): the name you invoice
  under, your VAT and company numbers, how customers reach you, and where the
  money goes. The **IBAN is checked before it is saved** — against your
  country's length and its check digits — because a mistyped account number is
  only ever discovered by the payment that never arrives.

- **alo Billing: issue an invoice, and quote for the work first.** A draft
  invoice now has an **Issue** button. It asks first, and says exactly what it
  is about to do: take the next number in your series, date the document, and
  freeze it for good. After that the invoice is a record — correct it with a
  **credit note**, which raises a draft mirroring every line for you to trim
  down to a partial credit, or **void** one nobody has seen (it keeps its
  number, because a number that vanished is a hole in your books). Nothing is
  emailed to anyone yet.
  **Quotes** are the same screen, one step earlier: raise a draft for a
  customer, put the same kind of lines on it, and mark it **sent** — which
  takes a quote number of its own and freezes the prices you offered. When the
  customer says yes, **Accepted** closes the offer and hands you a draft
  invoice with the identical lines at the identical prices, ready to issue;
  **Declined** and **Give up on it** close it without business. An offer past
  its date is flagged, not blocked — honouring one a few days late is your
  call. Every document says where it came from and what it became, so a quote,
  its invoice and any credit note are one click from each other. Printing and
  PDFs come next (ADR 0035).

- **alo Billing: your invoices, on screen.** Billing now opens on the
  **invoice list** — number, customer, dates, what it is worth — with a chip
  for where each document stands (draft, issued, paid, void) and a plain red
  row for anything **overdue**, judged by the server's date and not your
  browser's. Filter by status, or search by number, customer or their own
  reference. **New invoice** raises a draft for the customer you pick, and the
  **draft editor** is where you fill it in: add lines by hand or pick them
  straight from your price list (which copies the price and VAT rate as they
  are today, so changing your price list never rewrites a document). Quantities
  take three decimals — half an hour is `0.5`, a third of a kilo is `0.333` —
  and prices take whichever notation you normally type. The draft **saves
  itself** a moment after you stop typing, and the net, the VAT per rate and
  the total you see are the ones the server sent back; while an edit is still
  on its way they dim rather than pretend. A line without a description holds
  the save instead of quietly disappearing from the document. A draft can be
  deleted (it carries no number, so nothing is left behind); a document that
  has been issued shows as a frozen record. Issuing, credit notes and printing
  come next (ADR 0035).

- **alo Billing has a home in the workspace.** A **Billing** entry now sits in
  the rail (in alo workplace only — the standalone mail app is unchanged), with
  the two lists everything else is built from: your **customers** and your
  **price list**. Add a customer with their address, VAT id, invoice email,
  payment terms and currency, and the server tells you straight away if a VAT
  id does not add up. Add the things you sell once — name, unit, price, VAT
  rate — and pick them later instead of retyping them. Type a price the way you
  normally would (`1 234,56` or `1,234.56`, both work); what is stored is exact
  whole cents, and nothing about money is ever worked out in the browser.
  Neither list has a delete: you **archive** an entry, so it leaves the pickers
  while every document already raised still names it, and "show archived"
  brings it back into view. Invoices, quotes and the rest of the screens
  follow (ADR 0035).

- **alo Billing: an accepted quote becomes the invoice for it.** Marking an
  offer as accepted now also raises the **draft invoice** for it, in one move:
  every line copied at the price it was offered at, in the same order, worth
  exactly what the customer agreed to — down to the VAT per rate. The draft is
  an ordinary draft, so you can add the line you forgot before issuing it, and
  issuing it takes the next number in your invoice series as always. The two
  documents point at each other: the invoice names the quote it came from, and
  the quote names the invoice it produced. An offer that was declined or that
  lapsed is never billed, an offer can only be accepted once, and the whole
  thing is a single step — you will never find an accepted quote with nothing
  to bill it by. The quote surface itself is now live over the API
  (`/billing/quotes`), with the screens to follow (ADR 0035).

- **alo Billing: quotes, the offer before the invoice.** You can now draft a
  quote for a customer with exactly the same lines an invoice takes, and the
  server totals it the same way, to the cent. A draft is yours to change or
  throw away; **sending** it takes the next number in your quote series
  (`QUO-2026-00001` — a series of its own, so an offer nobody accepted never
  leaves a hole in your invoice numbering), stamps the day it went out and the
  day it stands until, and freezes it. An open offer is then **accepted**,
  **declined**, or marked **expired**, each recorded with the day it was
  decided; a quote list can be filtered by any of those. Nothing closes an
  offer behind your back — a quote past its date is shown as lapsed, and it is
  still yours to honour if you want to. Turning an accepted quote into a draft
  invoice, and the screens for all of this, arrive shortly (ADR 0035).

- **alo Billing: invoices, from draft to issued to credited.** The document
  itself is now live on the server. You raise a **draft** for a customer — lines
  with a description, a quantity, a unit price and a VAT rate — and the server
  works out the net, the VAT per rate, and the gross, every time, in whole
  cents; nothing about what a document is worth is ever computed in the browser
  or sent in by a client. A draft is yours to change or discard. **Issuing** it
  is the moment it becomes a legal document: it takes the next number in your
  unbroken series (`INV-2026-00001`), is stamped with the day it was issued and
  the day it is due from the payment terms it was raised with, and is frozen —
  an issued invoice is never edited afterwards. From there you either **void**
  it (it keeps its number and stops being owed, so your series stays gapless) or
  **credit** it: one click raises a mirrored credit note, drawing on the same
  series, that you can trim to a partial credit before issuing. The two
  documents together sum to exactly zero, so a corrected invoice reconciles
  against the customer's copy to the cent. The invoice list can be filtered by
  status and flags anything past its due date as **overdue**. The screens for
  all of this arrive shortly (`/billing/invoices`; ADR 0035).

- **alo Billing: your customers and your price list, over the API.** The first
  working part of alo Billing is live on the server: a tenant-wide list of the
  companies you invoice — address, country, VAT id, payment terms, currency,
  optionally linked to a contact in your address book — and a price list of the
  things you sell, each with a unit, a price, and a VAT rate. VAT ids are checked
  against the rules of the country they name, so a typo is caught when it is
  entered rather than on an invoice. Nothing is ever deleted: an item you stop
  selling, or a customer you stop working with, is **archived** — out of the
  pickers, still there to explain last year's books. Prices are held in whole
  cents from end to end, so nothing rounds behind your back. The screens for all
  of this arrive shortly (`/billing/customers` and `/billing/products`; ADR 0035).

- **alo Sheet ribbon: borders, rotation, wrapping, merge, and cell styles.** The
  Home ribbon now covers cell **borders**, **text rotation**, **wrapping**
  (overflow / wrap / clip), **merging** (all, across, vertically, unmerge), and a
  **cell styles** gallery (Default, Heading 1–3, and more) — the everyday
  formatting an Excel hand expects, all on alo's own ribbon.

- **alo Sheet is a complete Excel replacement.** You can now create a spreadsheet
  (**New → Sheet**), edit it, **open a real `.xlsx`** — which imports straight into
  alo Sheet, no third-party editor — and **download any sheet back as `.xlsx`**
  (a button in the sheet toolbar) to send a genuine Excel file to anyone. Values,
  numbers, and multiple sheets round-trip; complex styling and charts are
  best-effort. Imports never touch your original file — it stays in Drive. The
  redundant "New → Excel" (Collabora) entry is gone; "Sheet" is the one way to
  make a spreadsheet. First format fully moved onto alo's own editors (ADR 0033).

- **Equations in documents.** In an alo Doc, type `/equation` (or `/formula`,
  `/math`) to add a math formula written in LaTeX — `E = mc^2`, `\frac{a}{b}`,
  and so on — rendered cleanly on the page. Click a formula to edit it. Code
  blocks are already there via `/code`.

- **AI in documents — propose, then approve.** In an alo Doc, **Ask AI** lets you
  tell the AI what to write or change ("draft an intro about…", "summarise this").
  The AI comes back with a **proposal you review** — nothing is added to your
  document until you click **Insert** (or **Discard** to throw it away). The AI
  never edits your document silently; that's the promise. ADR 0029.

- **Ask your workspace (AI).** The search box (Ctrl/Cmd-K) now has an **Ask AI**
  option: ask a question in plain language — "where's the Acme proposal?", "what
  did we decide about pricing?" — and get an answer drawn from **your own files,
  tasks, and email**, with the sources it used listed and clickable underneath.
  The AI only ever sees what you could already open — it can't widen your access —
  and it answers *from your sources*, citing them, rather than making things up.
  If no AI model is set up yet (an admin configures one), you still get the
  matching files/tasks/email, just without the written answer. ADR 0029.

- **You see exactly what Ask AI will do before it does it.** Every action the
  agent proposes now shows a **preview card**: a draft or reply shows the
  recipient, subject and the full text; a move shows the target folder; a snooze
  shows the wake time. **Sending** — the one step that can't be undone — carries
  its own caution note and a distinct **Send** button. Nothing runs until you
  press Approve. ADR 0034.

- **Ask AI can tidy your inbox — with your approval.** Beyond answering, **Ask AI**
  can now act on your email: ask it to "archive the Acme newsletter", "delete the
  spam from billing", "snooze the invoice until Monday 9am", "flag the contract",
  or "mark the release note as read", and it finds the message you mean and shows
  you the single action it proposes. Nothing happens until you press **Approve** —
  then it archives, moves to Trash, snoozes (the email slips out of the inbox and
  comes back at the time you chose), flags/unflags, or marks read/unread that one
  email. It only ever touches your own mailbox, and it will say so plainly when it
  can't do what you asked yet. ADR 0034.

- **Ask AI can draft an email — new or a reply — for you.** Ask it to "email
  bob@acme.com asking to move our meeting to Friday", or "reply to the Globex
  invoice saying I'll pay Monday", and it writes the message and — once you
  **Approve** — saves it to your **Drafts** to review and send yourself. A reply
  is addressed to the original sender and stays in the same conversation thread.
  It never sends on its own, and the sender is always your own address (it can't
  write as anyone else). ADR 0034.

- **Ask AI can send a draft — only when you approve, and only a draft.** After you
  have a draft (one you wrote, or one Ask AI drafted for you), you can ask Ask AI
  to send it; it shows you the send as a proposal and delivers it **only after you
  press Approve**. It will only ever send a message that is already in your Drafts
  — never an arbitrary email — and it goes out through the normal signed-sending
  path, moving to Sent just as if you had clicked Send yourself. ADR 0034.

- **Ask AI can file an email into one of your folders.** Ask it to "move this to
  Work" or "file the payslip under Payroll" and — once you **Approve** — it takes
  the message out of your inbox and into that folder. It only ever uses folders
  you already have (it won't invent one from a typo), and if you name a folder
  that doesn't exist it says so instead of guessing. ADR 0034.

- **Workspace search (files, tasks + email content).** A search box in the left
  rail (or **Ctrl/Cmd-K** anywhere) searches across your **files, tasks and
  email** at once, and a result jumps you straight to it — opening the file, task
  or message. Files and tasks match by name; **email matches by full content**, so
  a word that appears only in the body of a message still finds it. It only ever
  shows what you can already see (your files, your Spaces, your tasks, your own
  mailbox); a teammate's private items, another person's mail, and other
  organisations never appear — and each app only shows results it can open.
  Search now also looks **inside your files**: text files, alo Docs, and
  **Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF** files are read for their text when you save
  them, so a word *inside* the document finds it, not just its name. (Scanned
  PDFs with no text layer, and images, stay findable by name — there's no OCR.)
  ADR 0029.

- **Real Word / Excel / PowerPoint editing in Drive (Collabora).** Open a
  `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx` (or OpenDocument) file in Drive and it now opens in a
  full editor **inside the workspace** — powered by Collabora, with genuine
  desktop-Office fidelity. Edits save straight back to Drive as new versions, and
  the file stays where it lives (shared with its Space's members). This is the
  *compatibility* type — for a great native document, use an alo Doc or alo Base.
  The editor is embedded same-origin behind our own WOPI host with short-lived,
  signed access tokens; the engine is a memory-capped pinned container so it
  can't disturb mail. ADR 0010. (New-from-blank Office files come next; for now,
  upload one and open it.)

- **alo Base — board, calendar & gallery views + select and link fields.** alo
  Base now feels like Airtable: add **Select** and **Multi-select** fields (with
  coloured chips), **Person** and **Link-to-another-table** fields, then look at
  the same records as a **grid**, a **board** (kanban — drag cards between
  columns to change their status), a **calendar** (records on the day of a date
  field), or a **gallery** (cards). Switching view never changes the data — it's
  the same records, seen differently. Add views with a picker (choose what to
  group or date by). ADR 0032.

- **alo Base — the grid you click (web UI).** "New base" in Drive creates an alo
  Base and opens its **editable grid**: columns are your typed fields, rows are
  records, and you edit **right in the cells** (text, number, date, checkbox).
  Add a row, add a column (choose its type), and add more tables — all saving as
  you go. It opens inside the workspace like the doc editor, and (like everything
  in Drive) it's shared by where it lives. Board/calendar/gallery views over the
  same rows, linked records, and more field types come next. ADR 0032.

- **alo Base — a relational data table (backend).** alo's native "sheet" isn't a
  grid of cells — it's a small database with a spreadsheet face (Airtable-style).
  A Base lives in Drive like any file (in My Files or a Space, auto-shared with
  members); it has tables with **typed fields** (text, number, date, checkbox,
  select, attachment, person, and link-to-record), records, and **multiple views
  over the same records** (grid/board/calendar/gallery — switching view never
  changes data). The engine is live and verified on the server: a Space viewer
  can read but not edit, another organisation gets "not found", and bad field
  types are rejected. The grid you'll click comes next; then linked records and
  the office-file compatibility editors. ADR 0032.

- **alo Doc — a block editor in Drive (first slice).** "New doc" in Drive creates
  an **alo Doc** — a clean, Notion-style block document (headings, lists, tables,
  quotes, images, and more) that opens right inside the workspace. It lives in
  Drive like any file: in your My Files or a Space (auto-shared with that Space),
  and **every change auto-saves as a new version** you can roll back to. It's the
  alo-native document type, distinct from a Word file (which opens in the
  compatibility editor) — ADRs 0030–0032. Coming next on top of this: technical
  authoring (math/code), live data blocks, and propose-then-approve AI.

- **Drive — the file manager (web UI).** Drive is now a module in the app: down
  the side, **My Files** and each **Space** you belong to, plus **Trash**. The
  main area shows the current folder with a breadcrumb, drag-or-click **upload**,
  **New folder**, and per-item actions — open, download, rename, move, make a
  copy, version history, and move-to-trash (restore or delete-forever from
  Trash). A Space shows **Members** (who has access), which managers can change.
  "Move to…" lets you shift a file between My Files and a Space — and because
  access follows location, that changes who can see it. Built for the live app;
  the document types (alo Doc / alo Base / Word-Excel compatibility) come next.

- **Drive — files, in one coherent place (backend).** Every file lives in exactly
  one spot: your private **My Files**, or a **Space** (where it's automatically
  shared with that Space's members). No OneDrive-vs-SharePoint split, no per-file
  permission maze — a file's access is simply its location's access. You get
  folders, upload, download, rename, move, copy, trash/restore, and full version
  history with restore. **Moving a file changes who can see it** (into a Space
  shares it; out of it un-shares it) — verified on the live server, along with:
  a Space viewer can read but not change files (a clean "not allowed"), and
  another organisation gets "not found" on everything. The file manager UI comes
  next. ADR 0027.

- **Spaces — the shared home for team work (foundation).** A Space (e.g. "Acme
  project") is a group with named members and three plain roles — viewer,
  editor, manager. It's the spine the whole suite will plug into: files first,
  then tasks, mailboxes, and more, all inheriting one membership instead of the
  per-item permission maze. Membership is always visible, a manager changes it,
  and a Space always keeps at least one manager. Everything is scoped to your
  organisation: a non-member can't even see a Space exists, and another
  organisation gets a clean "not found". ADRs 0026–0029.

- **Single sign-on for standalone products (token introspection).** The login
  system can now tell a separate product's backend not just *who* signed in but
  *which organisation* they belong to — the piece that lets a genuinely
  standalone app (Drive next) share the one workspace login without copying the
  login code or its database. It's a protected, off-by-default endpoint
  (RFC 7662); nothing changes for existing apps. Groundwork for ADR 0025.

- **Desktop 0.1.10**: bundles everything since 0.1.9 — task attachments, labels,
  followers, and "blocked by" dependencies, the branded date picker, and the
  Timeline dependency arrows. Installed apps auto-update.

- **Task dependencies ("blocked by").** A task can now be marked as blocked by
  another; the task detail lists what's blocking it, with a picker to add or
  remove blockers, and the Timeline draws an arrow from each blocker to the task
  it holds up. A task can't block itself, and — like everything else — you can
  only link tasks you can already see, so a dependency never points across
  organisations or into someone else's private project.

- **Task followers.** You can follow a task to keep an eye on it; whoever
  creates a task follows it automatically, and the assignee and anyone else can
  follow or unfollow from the task detail. The follower list shows each person's
  avatar. Following is scoped to your organisation — you can only follow tasks
  you can already see, and a follow request for another organisation's task is
  refused.

- **Desktop 0.1.9**: bundles the redesigned Home, Calendar, and Tasks (List /
  Board / Timeline / Calendar / Overview, the new-task modal, and the branded
  dialogs). Installed apps auto-update.

- Fixed: **Desktop app (Windows) opened to a blank window.** The "open external
  links in your browser" behaviour was mistaking the app's own local address for
  an outside site on Windows, so it never loaded. The app now opens straight to
  your workspace. Also: the desktop app no longer shows the old File/Edit menu
  bar on Windows/Linux (macOS keeps its standard menu), and interface text is no
  longer selectable like a web page — only message bodies and fields are. Ship
  0.1.8; installs on the auto-update feed refresh automatically.
- Fixed: **Deleting a tenant now removes its tasks too.** Task projects and
  tasks were left behind when a tenant was deleted (they weren't tied to the
  tenant record); they are now purged with it, like the rest of a tenant's data.
- New: **Turn an email into a task.** Open a message, and "Create a task" (in the
  ⋯ menu) makes a task from it — titled with the subject and linked back to the
  message. On the task, "Open the source email" jumps straight to that message.
  Where a tenant has AI configured, "Suggest tasks from this email" reads the
  message and drops candidate to-dos into your task inbox to accept or dismiss —
  it never adds them to your board on its own. The source link stays inside your
  tenant: it can only ever open a message you're already allowed to read.
- New: **Tasks.** A calm, fast task manager — the third leg of mail + calendar +
  tasks. Board (kanban) and list are two views of the *same* tasks: switch
  instantly, drag a card between columns to change its status or reorder within
  one. Each task has an assignee, due date, priority, subtasks, comments, and a
  history; the detail slides in from the side without leaving your board.
  Personal tasks are private; team projects are shared. A task can remember the
  email or event it came from, a due date can surface on the calendar, and the
  AI *suggests* action items you accept or dismiss — it never creates tasks
  silently. In English, French, and Dutch.
- New: **Dutch (Nederlands).** The whole interface is now available in Dutch —
  pick it under Account → Language (it's also auto-selected for Dutch browsers).
  Alongside English and French, for Belgian/Flemish teams.
- New: **Shared calendars sync to your phone.** Every calendar you can see —
  your own and any shared with you — now appears as its own calendar on your
  phone / Apple Calendar / Thunderbird over CalDAV, with its name and colour;
  read-only shared calendars show as read-only. (Your existing personal calendar
  is unchanged.) Times written in a named time zone are handled correctly, and
  clients that ask for a specific date range now get just that range.
- New: **Event reminders.** Set a reminder on any event — from "at the time of
  the event" up to "1 day before" — and it fires natively on your phone / Apple
  Calendar (synced as a calendar alarm), even when the app is closed.
- New: **See when people are free.** When you add guests to an event, **Check
  availability** shows who is busy at that time (within your organization) so you
  can schedule around conflicts — busy/free only, never their event details.
- New: **See who's coming.** When a guest accepts, declines, or answers "maybe"
  to your invitation, their reply is now recorded on the event, so opening it
  shows each guest's status instead of the reply just sitting in your inbox.
- New: **More repeat options.** Events can repeat on specific weekdays
  (e.g. every Mon/Wed/Fri, or every weekday) and on monthly patterns like the
  2nd Tuesday or the last day of the month. A new **Every weekday** preset is in
  the repeat picker.
- New: **Per-occurrence changes reach your phone, and guests.** Editing or
  skipping a single occurrence of a repeating event now syncs that one instance
  to your phone over CalDAV, and — if the event has guests — emails them so just
  that occurrence moves or drops off their calendar too.
- Fixed: **alomails shows only Mail + Calendar again.** The web deploy was
  building the full workplace surface, so the sidebar briefly showed Chat, Drive,
  and Meet — products that aren't part of alomails. The publish step now builds
  the mail surface (`ALO_PRODUCT=mail`), so alomails is Home, Mail, and Agenda.
- New: **Edit a single event in a repeating series.** Opening one occurrence of a
  recurring event now offers **This event** or **All events** on save — move or
  rename just this Tuesday's standup while the rest of the series stays put, or
  apply the change to the whole series. Skipping a single occurrence (delete →
  "This event") already existed; this is its editing counterpart. For now the
  per-occurrence edit shows in the app; it does not yet propagate to phones over
  CalDAV (the series still syncs) — that follow-on is tracked in the calendar
  notes.
- New: **Shared and team calendars.** You can now share a calendar with a
  colleague by email, or with a whole group (team) at once, giving them either
  **view** or **edit** access. Shared calendars appear in everyone's sidebar
  marked with their access level; a view-only calendar opens read-only, while an
  editor can add and change its events. Owners get a **Share** button on any
  calendar they own to add or remove people and groups at any time. Sharing is
  strictly within your organization — a calendar can only ever be shared with
  people in the same tenant, never across the boundary.
- New: **A landing page at alomails.com.** The bare domain now has a proper
  marketing page — what alomails is (private, sovereign email + calendar, hosted
  in Europe) with app downloads — while the app itself stays on
  mail.alomails.com. The apex has its own certificate; the app's TLS and mail
  are untouched. The site itself lives in its own repo
  (`aloworld-org/alomails-website`); only the serving glue is here.
- New: **Skip one occurrence of a repeating event.** Deleting a single instance
  of a recurring series — "cancel *this* Tuesday's standup, keep the rest" —
  now removes just that occurrence while the series stays. Opening a repeating
  event offers **This event** or **All events**. The exclusion rides along to
  your phone and Apple Calendar over CalDAV (an iCalendar `EXDATE`), and
  exclusions made there sync back. (Editing a single occurrence in place is the
  next step.)
- New: **Event cancellations.** When an organizer calls off a meeting, alomails
  removes it from your calendar automatically and shows a clear "Cancelled"
  notice on the email — no stale events left behind. And when you cancel an event
  you organized (delete it), every guest is emailed a cancellation so it drops
  off their calendar too. Works with Gmail, Outlook, and Apple both ways.
- New: **RSVP to invitations you receive.** When a calendar invitation lands in
  your inbox — from anyone on Gmail, Outlook, or Apple — alomails shows an
  **Accept / Maybe / Decline** card right in the reading pane, with the event's
  time, place, and who invited you. Accept (or Maybe) drops the event onto your
  calendar and emails a proper reply back to the organizer so their calendar
  updates too; Decline just sends the reply. Together with sending invitations,
  the full invite loop now works both ways.
- New: **Invite guests to an event.** Add email addresses to an event and, when
  you save, alomails emails each guest a standard invitation (iMIP `REQUEST`)
  from your address — so anyone on Gmail, Outlook, or Apple Calendar gets a real,
  RSVP-able invite in their own calendar, and editing the event re-sends an
  update. (Receiving invitations back as RSVPs in alomails comes next.)
- New: **Recurring events.** When you create or edit an event, pick how it
  repeats — every day, week, month, or year — and it fills the calendar going
  forward (with an optional end). The repeat rides along to your phone/Apple
  Calendar over CalDAV, and events created there with a repeat show up in
  alomails too. Editing or deleting a repeating event changes the whole series;
  per-occurrence exceptions come later.
- New: **Your alomails calendar syncs to your phone and computer (CalDAV).** Add
  your alo account to iPhone/iPad or macOS Calendar, Android (via a CalDAV app),
  or Thunderbird, and the events you create in alomails appear there — and events
  you add on your phone sync back. It rides the same one-account setup as your
  contacts (CardDAV), with incremental sync so only changes move.
- New: **Calendar, built right into alomails.** alomails is now Mail **and**
  Calendar in one app — the Gmail/Outlook shape — with a familiar month and week
  Agenda: a "New event" button, click a day or time slot to add one, and click
  an event to edit or delete it. Events live on your own account, tenant-isolated
  like everything else. (First slice: personal timed and all-day events; syncing
  to your phone / Apple Calendar via CalDAV, and emailed invitations, come next.)
- New: **alomails as a real desktop app.** Download an installable app from
  **mail.alomails.com/download** — its own window and dock/taskbar icon, not a
  browser tab. The full alomails interface is **bundled inside the app** and
  loads locally (instant, works offline until it needs the network), talking to
  your alomails account over a secure connection — an installed program, not a
  window pointed at the website. It's built with Tauri (Rust shell + the existing
  web UI, uses the system webview — no bundled browser), so it's the same app you
  know with nothing rewritten (ADR 0005). Windows ships now; the macOS .dmg
  builds on CI. **The app keeps itself up to date:** on launch it checks a
  signed update feed and, if a newer version is out, downloads it, verifies its
  signature, installs it, and relaunches — silently, in the background, so you
  download it once. (Still unsigned to the OS, so the first install may warn
  about an unidentified developer until code-signing certificates are added —
  that's separate from the update signing, which is already in place.)
- New: **Forgot your password? Reset it yourself.** A "Forgot password?" link on
  the sign-in screen now starts a self-service reset: enter your alo address, get
  a code at the recovery mailbox you set up at signup, and choose a new password —
  no admin needed. The request step always looks the same whether or not the
  address exists, so it never reveals who has an account; the code is short-lived,
  attempt-capped, and rate-limited, exactly like signup. (Applies to accounts
  created from this release on, since it needs the recovery mailbox on file.)
- Fixed: **The alomails sign-in no longer looks like a company login.** The
  standalone mail product now shows a personal email hint (`you@alomails.com`
  instead of `you@yourdomain.com`) and drops the enterprise "Sign in with SSO"
  button — leaving Sign in + "Create a personal account". The workspace build
  keeps SSO and the bring-your-own-domain hint. Both are product-surface
  settings, so each product shows the right login.
- New: **alomails speaks its own language on the sign-in screen.** The standalone
  mail product's login now reads as an email service ("Your mail. Your privacy.
  Your rules.", "Sovereign email · Hosted in Europe") instead of the workspace
  copy. The brand text is part of the product surface, so each product carries
  its own — and it stays fully translatable (English + French shipped).
- Fixed: **Typing the bare mail domain now works.** Visiting `mail.example.com`
  (plain HTTP) previously connected to nothing and errored; it now redirects to
  HTTPS. Caddy serves port 80 for the redirect while the Let's Encrypt renewal
  challenge is served from a shared webroot — so certificate auto-renewal keeps
  working without certbot needing its own public port. Verified with a live
  renewal dry-run.
- New: **alomails — the Mail product as its own app.** Built with
  `ALO_PRODUCT=mail`, the standalone alomails surface ships Home + Mail only
  (no workspace, authoring, or suite-admin modules) and the browser tab now
  reads *alomails* rather than *alo workplace*. This is the trimmed bundle
  served at mail.alomails.com; the full workspace build is unchanged.
- New: **Mail apps set themselves up (autoconfig).** Add your alo address in
  Thunderbird, Apple Mail, or Outlook and the app fills in the servers and
  ports for you — no more typing IMAP/SMTP hostnames by hand. (Requires two
  small DNS records for your mail domain; see the deployment guide.)
- New: **Bring your old mail in (IMAP import).** A new **Import mail** item
  in your account menu pulls recent messages from another mailbox — pick
  **Gmail** or **Outlook** (the server address is filled in for you) or
  enter any IMAP server, sign in, and your mail is copied into alo over a
  verified TLS connection. **All your folders come across** — Sent, Drafts,
  Junk, Trash, Archive and your own folders are recreated, and each
  message keeps its read / starred / answered state. Re-running is safe:
  messages already imported are skipped, not duplicated. For Gmail and
  Outlook, use an app password (their normal password won't work for mail
  apps).
- Improved: **Mail works on a phone.** On a small screen the mailbox now
  shows one pane at a time — your message list, then the conversation
  when you tap it, with a back button to return — and folders slide in
  from a menu button instead of squeezing the layout. The desktop
  three-pane view is unchanged.
- New: **Contacts sync to your phone and computer (CardDAV).** Add your
  alo account to iPhone/iPad, macOS Contacts, Android (via a CardDAV
  app), or Thunderbird, and your address book syncs both ways
  automatically — add a contact on your phone and it's on the web, and
  vice versa. Point the client at your alo server and sign in with your
  normal email and password.
- New: **Address book (contacts).** A new **Contacts** panel in your
  account menu lets you keep an address book — names, multiple emails
  and phone numbers, organization, job title, notes — with search,
  create, edit, and delete. Saved contacts show up first when you're
  picking recipients in compose. **Import and Export** move your whole
  address book in and out as a standard `.vcf` file, so you can bring
  your Gmail/Outlook/Apple contacts straight in (and back them up).
  (Automatic device sync follows.)
- New: **alo now speaks French — and can speak more.** A full,
  native-quality French translation of the whole app, switchable from a
  new **Language** control in your account menu; your choice is
  remembered, and new visitors get their browser's language
  automatically. The translation framework underneath makes adding more
  European languages a matter of dropping in a catalog — Dutch and
  German are next.
- New: **Abuse controls for inbound and outbound mail.** A single
  source IP can no longer monopolise the server — each is capped to a
  fair number of simultaneous connections (excess get a polite "try
  again"), and unknown senders are greylisted (briefly deferred, which
  most spam sources never retry). Outbound, a per-destination send-rate
  limit protects the server's sending reputation if an account is ever
  compromised — a sudden flood is smoothed into a steady trickle rather
  than blasted out. All tunable, and the outbound limiter is off by
  default for single-tenant servers.
- New: **Incoming mail is scanned for malware** (ClamAV, ~3.6 M
  signatures, auto-updating). A message carrying a known threat is
  refused at the door with a clear reason — it never reaches a
  mailbox — and if the scanner is ever down, mail is politely deferred
  rather than let through unscanned. Operators disable by unsetting
  `ALO_SMTP_CLAMAV_ADDR`.
- New: **Marking mail as junk now trains the spam filter.** Moving a
  message into Junk reports it as spam; moving it back out reports it
  as ham — the filter (Rspamd Bayes) learns from your real mail and
  gets sharper over time. Deployments gain a small redis service for
  the learning store; this also fixes Bayes being silently inactive at
  scan time (it had no token backend). Training is best-effort and
  never delays or blocks moving mail.
- New: **Outgoing mail to DANE-protected servers is now
  tamper-proof-encrypted** (RFC 7672). When a destination publishes
  DNSSEC-signed TLSA records, alo validates the DNSSEC chain itself,
  makes TLS mandatory (no downgrade-to-cleartext, ever), and verifies
  the server's certificate against the published records — closing the
  classic STARTTLS-stripping attack for those destinations. Servers
  without TLSA keep today's opportunistic encryption. Operators can
  disable with `ALO_SMTP_DANE=off`.
- New: **DMARC aggregate reports are now sent** (RFC 7489 §7.2). The MX
  records every inbound DMARC evaluation and a daily job mails each
  sender domain's published `rua=` address a gzipped XML report of what
  we saw — source IPs, alignment outcomes, applied dispositions. This
  is the feedback loop other domain owners rely on; external report
  addresses are verified per §7.1 before anything is sent. Operators
  can disable with `ALO_SMTP_DMARC_REPORTS=off` (migration 0033).
- New: **Forwarded mail keeps its proof of authenticity (ARC).** Mail
  forwarded by a filter rule ("redirect") is now ARC-sealed (RFC 8617):
  the receiving server can verify the SPF/DKIM/DMARC results we saw at
  ingress even though forwarding breaks SPF, so forwards stop failing
  DMARC downstream. Sealed with the forwarding domain's own DKIM key;
  operators can disable with `ALO_SMTP_ARC_SEALING=off`.
- New: **alo Transfer — large files as links.** A file too big to attach
  (over 25 MB) uploads once and rides the message as a private, expiring download
  link instead of an inline attachment, so it sidesteps recipient
  attachment-size limits. **No size limit** — the file is streamed straight to
  storage — and **you choose how long the link lives** (1 / 7 / 30 / 90 days).
  In compose it shows as a link chip with an expiry picker; the sent message
  carries a tidy download card. Links are unguessable and served as a forced
  download, never rendered inline (`POST /share/upload`, public streaming
  `GET /share/{token}`, migrations 0026–0027).
- New: **Colored labels.** Custom folders can be color-coded — a colored dot in
  the sidebar, set from a right-click palette (or cleared). Colors round-trip on
  `Mailbox/get`/`Mailbox/set` and are validated to a strict `#rrggbb` (migration
  0025).
- Improved: **Settings redesigned** as a two-pane preferences panel (General ·
  Filters & rules · Organization) with proper section headers and cards, in
  place of the old flat single column.
- New: **Filters & rules + Block sender.** A visual rule builder in Settings:
  match incoming mail on From / To / Cc / Subject (contains / is, all or any)
  and act — move to a folder, mark read, star, or delete. Rules run **on the
  server at delivery**, even when you're offline, and the first match applies.
  **Block sender** is one click in a conversation's ⋯ menu — that address's mail
  goes straight to Junk. Rules compile to a single managed Sieve script that
  also carries any out-of-office auto-reply, so the two coexist
  (`GET`/`PUT /filters`, `POST /filters/block`, migration 0024).
- New: **Recipient autocomplete.** Typing in To / Cc / Bcc drops down matching
  recent correspondents (name + address) for one-click selection — arrow keys
  and Enter, or click. The list is mined from your recent mail, ranked by how
  often and how recently you've corresponded, and your own addresses are left
  out (`GET /contacts`).
- New: **Send later.** Schedule a composed message for a chosen time instead of
  sending now — the Send button has a **▾ menu** (Tomorrow morning / afternoon,
  Monday morning, or a custom date & time). The draft moves to a **Scheduled**
  folder and a background sweeper sends it when due, filing it to Sent; **Cancel
  send** (reading pane) returns it to Drafts. Scheduling runs the same send-from
  validation as an immediate send, so a forbidden send is refused up front; the
  sweeper claims each due message before it hits the wire, so a crash can never
  double-send (`POST /send-later`, migration 0023).
- New: **AI smart replies.** When AI is configured, an open conversation shows up
  to **three short, ready-to-send replies** as pills below the thread (only when
  the newest message is from someone else). Picking one opens a reply
  **pre-filled** with that text, ready to edit or send. Soft-degrades like the
  rest of the AI suite — the pills simply don't appear when AI is off
  (`POST /ai/replies`).
- New: **Gmail-style mail.** The conversation list is now compact two-line rows
  (sender · time / subject — snippet), unread bold, with a star and hover
  **archive / delete / read** actions; **bulk select** (row checkboxes → a
  select-all bar with batch archive/delete/read/snooze). Expanded messages
  collapse the **quoted history behind a "···"** and show a **"to me ▾"**
  recipient expander.
- New: **Snooze.** Hide a conversation until later (Later today / Tomorrow /
  This weekend / Next week) from the reading pane or the bulk bar; it moves to a
  **Snoozed** folder and a background sweeper returns it to the Inbox, unread,
  when due (migration 0021; `POST /snooze`).
- New: **Math & code in emails.** The compose toolbar can insert an **equation**
  (the LaTeX editor with a live preview) and a **code block** (dark, with a
  language picker). Equations are sent as **MathML** and code as a
  self-contained **inline-styled block**, so they render in alo's reading
  pane and other modern clients; the message's plain-text part carries the raw
  LaTeX and fenced code as the universal fallback. KaTeX/Prism are code-split —
  loaded only when a user inserts one, never on the normal mail path (ADR 0015).
- New: **alo Docs — real documents.** Technical authoring is now a working
  editor, not a demo: each user creates, opens, renames, and deletes their own
  **documents** (tenant- and owner-scoped store; a document is reachable only by
  its owner — isolation is tested). The editor is **block-based** — add, reorder,
  and delete headings, prose (with inline `$math$` and `{{cross-references}}`),
  numbered display equations, dark syntax-highlighted code blocks, and editable
  tables — and **autosaves** as you type. New API: `GET/POST /docs`,
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /docs/{id}` (migration 0020, `documents`). Reached via Drive.
- New: **Technical authoring in alo Docs.** Write specs with math and code,
  all rendered **in the browser** (no draft equation or line of code leaves the
  client): an **equation editor** with a LaTeX input, a live **KaTeX** preview, a
  LaTeX/Visual toggle, a common-symbol quick bar, and inline vs numbered display
  equations; **code blocks** with **Prism** highlighting, a searchable language
  picker (explicit, never guessed), copy, and line numbers; and **cross-references
  with auto-numbering** — equations, tables, figures, and sections number
  themselves and reference chips ("Eq. 3", "Table 1", "Section 2.3") stay correct
  when items are reordered or inserted, with an insert-cross-reference picker
  (tabs). Ships as a standalone alo Docs surface (reached via Drive) that will
  dock into the Collabora Docs shell when that lands. KaTeX + Prism are MIT; the
  numbering/reference layer is alo's own (ADR 0015). The libraries are
  code-split, so the mail app never loads them.
- New: **Cc and Bcc.** Compose sends to Cc and Bcc recipients; the reading pane
  shows the full To / Cc / Bcc of each message. Bcc is written into the sender's
  own copy (so Sent records who was blind-copied) but the server **strips the
  Bcc header from the transmitted bytes**, so recipients never see it — while
  Bcc addresses are still delivered via the envelope. A received message's Bcc is
  always empty, and Cc (never Bcc) joins the searchable text.
- New: **AI conversation summary.** Opening a conversation can produce a short
  alo-written summary through the tenant's configured model
  (`POST /ai/summarize`), degrading quietly when AI is off.
- New: **Verified sender badge.** A message whose inbound authentication passed
  (DMARC, or DKIM in DMARC's absence) shows a "Verified" pill in the reading pane.
- New: **Out-of-office auto-reply.** A settings toggle (account menu → Settings)
  with an optional subject and a message; turning it on installs and activates a
  managed `out-of-office` Sieve **vacation** script, so replies go out through
  the existing vacation machinery (one reply per correspondent, suppression
  window). Turning it off removes it. `GET /settings/mail` reports it;
  `POST /settings/out-of-office` sets it (a message is required to enable).
- New: **Real mail search.** The search box now runs a **server-side full-text
  search across the whole account** (JMAP `Email/query` over the message
  tsvector index) instead of filtering only the loaded page; results are
  grouped into conversations and open in the reading pane. Debounced; a cleared
  box returns to the folder view.
- New: **Mail signatures + organization footer.** Each user sets a rich-text
  **signature** (account menu → Settings) inserted into new messages and
  replies; tenant admins set a tenant-wide **organization footer** appended
  after every user's signature. Endpoints: `GET /settings/mail`,
  `POST /settings/signature` (any user), `POST /admin/org-footer` (admin);
  stored per user / per tenant, empty clears.
- New: **Undo send.** A sent message is held for a few seconds with an **Undo**
  action before it actually submits; Undo leaves it in Drafts. A queued send is
  never lost (it flushes on window-elapse or navigation).
- New: **Per-tenant DKIM signing keys.** Verifying a domain now provisions its
  own Ed25519 DKIM key (ADR 0014); outbound mail is signed with the key for the
  message's `From` domain, so each tenant signs as itself (DMARC-aligned). The
  Domains page shows the DKIM record to publish and offers **Rotate** (selector
  rollover — the old record stays valid until removed). The secret key never
  leaves the server or a client response. The existing single deployment key
  (`ALO_SMTP_DKIM_*`) is unchanged and remains the fallback, so single-tenant
  deployments sign exactly as before. New route: `/admin/domains/dkim/rotate`;
  the `/admin/domains` listing gains a `dkim` record per domain. RSA keys are
  not generated in-process (Ed25519 only; operators needing RSA supply it via
  the file key). Groundwork for no-touch rotation once alo serves
  authoritative DNS (ADR 0013, deferred).
- New: **Admin console completed + storage quotas + audit log.** The tenant
  Admin console now opens on an **Overview** dashboard (users, storage,
  deliverability, AI) and adds a **Domains** page (register + DNS-verify the
  tenant's own domains, tenant-scoped) and an **Audit log** (every
  administrative action — who, what, target, when — newest first, including
  platform-operator actions on the tenant). **Per-tenant storage quotas**
  (operator-set; `NULL` = unlimited, the default) are enforced at the
  blob-write choke points: over-quota JMAP upload → **507**, `set` → `overQuota`,
  and inbound mail is deferred with a transient **452**. New operator env
  `ALO_AI_EGRESS` (default `open` for self-hosting; `restricted` on shared
  hosting requires https and blocks loopback/private/link-local AI endpoints —
  an SSRF guard with the vetted IP pinned) and `ALO_ENFORCE_DOMAIN_OWNERSHIP`
  (default `off`). Both deferred findings in
  `docs/design/multi-tenant-trust-boundary.md` are now closed.
- New: **Multi-tenant control plane (`alo-control`).** A dedicated
  platform-operator service (ADR 0012), separate from the tenant API, for
  governing a shared deployment: **tenant lifecycle** (list, provision a
  tenant + its first admin, suspend/resume, delete with an id-echo
  confirmation) and **tenant→domain ownership** (register a domain, verify it
  by a `_alo-verify` DNS TXT proof, list, remove). Operators are a new
  principal — a user carrying `is_platform_admin`, created by `identityctl
  bootstrap-operator`, authenticated by the same opaque token path as everyone
  else; an operator token authorizes `/control/*` governance only and is
  **never** a key into any tenant's mail. Address assignment
  (`create_user`/alias/list) can now be constrained to a tenant's verified
  domains — the fix for the cross-tenant mail-capture risk — behind
  `ALO_ENFORCE_DOMAIN_OWNERSHIP` (default off; flip once domains are
  registered). New service: compose `alo-control` + Caddy `/control/*`
  route. Schema (additive): `users.is_platform_admin`, `tenants.status`, a
  `domains` table. Design + threat model: ADR
  `0012-multi-tenant-control-plane.md`, `docs/design/multi-tenant-trust-boundary.md`.
- New: **Tenant Admin console + AI inference layer.** A full-screen,
  tenant-admin-only console (reached from the user menu, gated on the new
  `alo:isAdmin` session key) with four working pages: **Users & mailboxes**
  (create, reset password, grant/revoke admin with self-lockout protection,
  aliases, delete), **Groups & lists** (groups, membership, and distribution
  **list addresses** that fan inbound mail out to every member's inbox),
  **Security & trust** (live SPF/DKIM/DMARC/MX/reverse-DNS/MTA-STS
  deliverability checks run as real DNS + HTTPS queries against the email
  domain), and **AI providers**. New backend crate **`alo-ai`** speaks the
  OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions contract, so the AI backend is
  *configured, never bundled* — bring your own: local Ollama, a self-hosted
  model, or a hosted provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/custom), per tenant. The web
  Compose **"Improve"** action calls it via a new authenticated, tenant-scoped
  **`POST /ai/improve`** (new `alo:aiEnabled` session key hides the control
  when AI is off). API keys are stored server-side and **never returned to
  clients** (only a `hasKey` flag) or logged; prompts and completions are
  never logged (law #1). New HTTP surface: `/admin/users*`, `/admin/groups*`,
  `/admin/security/checks`, `/admin/ai/*`, `/ai/improve`. New operator env for
  the admin: `bootstrap-admin` marks the first user; the Security page reads
  `ALO_SMTP_LOCAL_DOMAINS` / `ALO_SMTP_DKIM_*`. Design + threat model:
  ADR `0011-ai-inference-layer.md`, `docs/design/multi-tenant-trust-boundary.md`.
- New: **Sending mail** — JMAP **`EmailSubmission/set`** (RFC 8621 §7), so the
  web app's Compose and Reply actually send. A composed message is built as a
  proper RFC 5322 `text/plain` message (all To/Cc, reply threading, and
  European-correct non-ASCII via RFC 2047 encoded-words + base64 body — no
  header injection) and sent through a new **trusted internal SMTP submission
  listener** so it is DKIM-signed, queued, and delivered by the existing
  outbound path, then filed to Sent. **Send-as is enforced on both the SMTP
  envelope and the visible `From:` header** (a token cannot send as another
  identity), only drafts are sendable, and recipients are capped per message.
  The outbound SMTP client is now a shared `alo-smtp-client` crate used by
  both the delivery path and this submission path (no duplication). New config:
  `ALO_SMTP_INTERNAL_SUBMISSION_ADDR` (never publish this port) and
  `ALO_JMAP_SUBMISSION_ADDR`. Design + security review:
  `docs/design/email-submission.md`.
- New: **alo web app** — the one-product workspace shell, web-first
  (`web/`). The "warm workshop" design system (paper / verdigris / copper /
  ink tokens, self-hosted Inter + EB Garamond, shared primitives), the left
  rail + layout frame with a module registry that Agenda/Chat/Drive/Docs plug
  into later, first-party **OIDC + PKCE** sign-in against `alo-identity`
  (2FA field revealed on demand), and a **Mail read surface** — folders,
  message list, and a reading pane that renders plain text in Garamond and
  isolates untrusted HTML in a sandboxed, CSP-locked iframe that blocks remote
  content (no tracking pixels). Served at the same origin as the API behind
  Caddy; sign-in verified end-to-end on the live deployment. Compose/reply,
  PWA/offline, and the other modules are the next items. Design note
  `docs/design/web-shell.md`.
- New: **`alo-identity`** — the credential authority and an **OpenID
  Connect / OAuth 2.0 provider** (alo-as-IdP). It replaces every interim
  auth path: SMTP AUTH, IMAP/POP3 `LOGIN`, and the JMAP bearer now
  authenticate through one crate, and the dev `StaticAuthenticator`, the
  store's interim `auth.rs`, and the SMTP credentials-file loader are
  **deleted**. Passwords are **argon2id** (OWASP-baseline parameters,
  documented as a contract and overridable per deployment); **every secret
  comparison is constant-time** (the `subtle` crate), and an unknown user
  still pays one argon2 hash so *wrong password* and *no such user* are
  indistinguishable in time — closing the timing oracle the M3 TLS audit
  pinned here (proven by a timing test, not asserted: unknown-vs-wrong
  ratio ≈ 1.0). Tokens and recovery codes are stored only as SHA-256
  hashes; secrets never appear in a log, error, or `Debug`. The identity
  model is **tenants → users → aliases + groups**; `account_by_email`
  (inbound routing) is **alias-aware**; a tenant's first admin is created
  by the `identityctl` **CLI**, never a public endpoint. The **OAuth
  provider** offers discovery (RFC 8414), a JWKS, `authorization_code` with
  **mandatory PKCE `S256`** (RFC 6749/7636 — `plain` and challenge-less
  codes refused), and token / userinfo / revocation (RFC 7009). **Access
  tokens are opaque and revocable** (a logout truly invalidates); refresh
  tokens rotate on use and a replayed refresh token **revokes the whole
  token chain**; authorization codes are single-use. **ID tokens are EdDSA
  (Ed25519) JWTs** with `kid` rotation designed in — `sub` is the stable
  opaque user id, never the email (ADR 0008 explains opaque-vs-JWT and
  EdDSA-vs-RS256). **TOTP 2FA** (RFC 6238) adds enrollment (provisioning
  URI), verification with a clock-drift window, and single-use recovery
  codes. **2FA is enforced everywhere it can be:** the OIDC flow prompts for
  the code, and the legacy protocols (IMAP/POP3/SMTP), which cannot prompt,
  **fail closed** for a TOTP-enabled account — a password-only login is
  refused (indistinguishably from a wrong password) so a phished password
  cannot bypass 2FA over IMAP. Credential endpoints — including the legacy
  ones — have per-`(client, )username` exponential backoff (not a lockout,
  which would be a denial-of-service lever). Reviewed + security-audited
  (two independent passes); cross-tenant **and** cross-account isolation is
  tested on every identity operation, and the OAuth flow's negative cases
  (wrong PKCE verifier, code/refresh replay → chain revoke, unregistered
  redirect, bad credentials) are covered. App-specific passwords + `XOAUTH2`
  are the sanctioned follow-up that lets a 2FA user drive a non-OAuth legacy
  client again. See `docs/design/identity.md` and
  `docs/decisions/0008-identity-and-token-model.md`.

- New: **inbound local delivery** — received mail now files into the account
  store with **Sieve at the boundary**, closing the SMTP → mailbox path
  (previously inbound mail terminated at a spool). On the MX role with a
  database configured, each `RCPT TO:` for a hosted domain is resolved against
  the store (`Store::account_by_email`, subaddress-aware): an **unknown local
  user is refused `550 5.1.1` at RCPT** (an honest immediate answer, never a
  silent drop or post-DATA backscatter), while the anti-open-relay guard still
  refuses non-local recipients to unauthenticated senders. At end of `DATA` the
  fully-stamped message (Received + Authentication-Results + body) is delivered
  to **each** resolved recipient through `AccountStore::deliver_sieve` (parse →
  spam score → Sieve → file), isolation inherited per recipient. Sieve
  `redirect`/`vacation` actions are enqueued through the existing outbound queue
  under the rule owner's identity, with all attacker-influenced header strings
  (`subject`/`from`/redirect address) **CR/LF-stripped before any header is
  built**, and the store's redirect-rate budget enforced on the real path.
  Delivery is **per-recipient, try-then-commit**: a transient store/blob fault
  yields a conservative whole-message `4xx` so the sender retries (RFC 5321 §6.1
  — **duplicate delivery is preferred to loss**; blobs dedup by content), and
  **no failure path loses mail**. Delivered bytes go to a **durable on-disk blob
  backend** (`BlobStore::local`, `ALO_SMTP_BLOB_DIR`, default `./blobs`), so a
  body survives a restart on single-node deployments without Garage/S3. The
  inbound **spool is retired as the local sink**: its all-local backlog is
  migrated into the store once at startup (before the queue runner claims), and
  it remains the outbound queue's durable store (unchanged). Reviewed +
  security-audited. See `docs/design/local-delivery.md` and the new inbound
  entries in `docs/interop.md`.

- New: **`alo-sieve`** + delivery-time filtering — user **Sieve** filter
  scripts (RFC 5228, with **vacation** RFC 5230, **subaddress** RFC 5233,
  **imap4flags** RFC 5232) compiled and run on the server at delivery time.
  Sieve scripts are user-supplied programs, so every limit is a security
  control: hard parse caps (script size, nesting depth, test-list length,
  string size) enforced *during* parse, an evaluation instruction budget,
  and `require` enforcement (an un-declared extension is a compile error).
  Actions keep/fileinto/discard/redirect/stop with **implicit keep**, and
  **no script failure ever loses mail** — a compile error, a budget overrun,
  or a `fileinto` to a non-existent folder (auto-create is off) all fall back
  to implicit keep. **Redirect storms are impossible by construction**
  (per-script count cap, per-account rolling rate budget, loop guards,
  self-redirect refusal) and **vacation** carries the full RFC 3834 backscatter
  guards plus per-correspondent `:days` suppression. Wired at the store's
  delivery entry (`AccountStore::deliver_sieve`, after spam scoring and before
  filing); scripts, suppression, and the redirect budget are per-account rows,
  so isolation is inherited (cross-tenant **and** cross-account CRUD and
  execution tested). **Rule management is JMAP for Sieve** (RFC 9661, ADR
  0007): `SieveScript/{get,set,validate}` compile-checked on `set`
  (`invalidScript`), with the sieve capability in the Session resource.
  Reviewed + security-audited. The `deliver_sieve` seam is now exercised on the
  real inbound path (see "inbound local delivery" above). See
  `docs/design/sieve-filtering.md` and `docs/decisions/0007-sieve-rule-management.md`.

- New: **`alo-imap`** — IMAP4rev2 (RFC 9051) / IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501) and
  POP3 (RFC 1939) **compatibility shims** over the account store, so the
  installed base of mail clients (Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Outlook, phones
  over IMAP) can reach a alo mailbox unchanged. JMAP stays the native
  protocol (ADR 0001); these are thin translators over `AccountStore`, so
  tenant/account isolation is **inherited**, not re-implemented. IMAP on
  implicit TLS (993) and STARTTLS (143), POP3 on implicit TLS (995);
  `LOGIN`/`AUTHENTICATE PLAIN`/`LOGIN` are refused before TLS (no
  credentials in the clear) and both protocols cap failed authentications
  per connection. Full command set: `SELECT`/`EXAMINE`, `LIST`/`LSUB`
  (correct `%`/`*` wildcards + RFC 6154 special-use), `CREATE`/`DELETE`/
  `RENAME`, `STATUS`, `APPEND` (through the **same** ingestion path as
  delivery — no second parser), `FETCH` (`ENVELOPE`, `INTERNALDATE`,
  `RFC822.SIZE`, `FLAGS`, byte-exact `BODY[]`/`[HEADER]`/`[TEXT]`/
  `[HEADER.FIELDS]`/numbered parts with `<partial>`, and a bounded-honest
  `BODYSTRUCTURE`), `STORE`, `SEARCH`, `EXPUNGE`, `COPY`/`MOVE` (RFC 6851,
  with `COPYUID`/`APPENDUID`), every `UID` variant, and `IDLE` (RFC 2177)
  as **account-scoped push** off the per-account change cursor.
  **Stable per-mailbox UIDs and UIDVALIDITY** (schema migration 0006):
  strictly-ascending, never reused within an epoch, stable across
  reconnection; `EXPUNGE` renumbers sequence numbers, never UIDs. Covered
  by a cross-tenant **and** cross-account isolation suite plus UID-
  stability, concurrent-session, malformed/oversized-input, pipelining,
  STARTTLS, and POP3 integration tests over real TLS; reviewed and
  security-audited. `CONDSTORE`/`QRESYNC`, `SORT`/`THREAD`, `ACL`/`QUOTA`/
  `METADATA`, and sub-second IDLE via `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` are additive
  follow-ups. See `docs/design/imap-pop3-shims.md`.

- Fixed: **account-scoped change visibility** — the JMAP/IMAP state cursor
  is now a **per-account** monotonic modseq (`account_modseq`, migration
  0005), not per-tenant, so a co-tenant user's activity can no longer
  advance another user's state token (closing a coarse activity-volume
  side channel and removing a spurious cross-account push wakeup). The
  change log was already per-account; only the counter was shared. State
  tokens stay opaque; `/changes` resumes unchanged.

- New: **`alo-jmap`** — the JMAP API (RFC 8620 core, RFC 8621 mail),
  an HTTP service over the store and alo's native client protocol.
  **A public contract from merge** (web/desktop/compat adapters speak
  it): the Session resource with honest, enforced limits; the
  Request/Response envelope with ordered method dispatch and result
  references (back-references); `Mailbox`, `Email`, and `Thread`
  `get`/`set`/`query`/`changes` mapped onto the store; blob
  upload/download (blob ids are the store's — one id space; download is
  tenant-scoped, served with the stored Content-Type and `nosniff`); and
  an EventSource push endpoint emitting `StateChange` per tenant with
  heartbeats. `/changes` is backed by a new per-tenant monotonic modseq
  and change log in the store (`alo-store::changes`), with opaque
  state tokens and an honest `cannotCalculateChanges`. **Interim bearer
  auth** (`/auth/token`, argon2 credentials in the store) resolves each
  token to `(tenant, account)` and enters the store only through
  `for_account` — behind a seam the future alo-identity OIDC replaces
  without touching method code. Isolation is **per-account** (accountId =
  user): every by-id read/mutate, `/changes`, `Thread/get`, and blob
  download is scoped to the token's `(tenant, user)`, so a user cannot
  reach another user's mail even within the same tenant. Covered by the
  wrong-tenant AND cross-account isolation suites (CI-gated), plus
  conformance, result-reference, concurrent-`/changes`, `/changes`
  pagination-group, and malformed/oversized-body tests, all against real
  Postgres.
  `EmailSubmission/set` (send), full MIME `bodyStructure`, and
  JMAP-over-WebSocket are follow-ups. See `docs/design/jmap-api.md`.

- New: **`alo-store`** — the account-scoped message store on
  PostgreSQL (system of record, via `sqlx` with compile-checked queries)
  and Garage/S3 (message bytes). **Isolation is structural, enforced by
  the type you hold:** user-owned mail data is reachable only through an
  `AccountStore`, obtained via `Store::for_account(TenantId, UserId)`,
  and every query bakes in its `(tenant, user)` predicate by construction
  — no API takes a `tenant_id` or `user_id` parameter, there is no
  ownership guard in any call path to forget, and a wrong-tenant *or*
  wrong-account lookup returns a clean `NotFound` (no cross-account
  oracle). Tenant-level provisioning (users, credentials) stays on a
  narrow `TenantStore` from `Store::for_tenant(TenantId)`. Entities: tenants, users, hierarchical mailboxes (with
  transactional total/unread counters), messages (with the parsed
  `Authentication-Results` verdict stored queryable), threads (RFC 8621
  §3 References-based), message↔mailbox membership, JMAP keywords/flags,
  and content-addressed blobs (SHA-256, per-tenant key prefix,
  ref-counted for a later GC sweep). Ids are opaque and random — no
  sequential integer crosses the API boundary. Ingestion writes the blob
  before the DB commit, so a crash leaves an invisible orphan (GC'd),
  never a visible message with a missing body. Full-text search
  (Postgres `tsvector`) over subject/addresses/body, updated in the same
  transaction as ingestion. Every list path is bounded by a `Page`. The
  Garage S3 backend is behind the `garage` cargo feature; tests use an
  in-memory backend. A **wrong-tenant and cross-account isolation suite**
  covers every public read and write path — proving two users of the same
  tenant cannot reach each other's rows with no guard in the path — and is
  required by CI, alongside threading
  property tests, concurrent-counter tests, and ingestion crash-safety
  tests (all against real Postgres). JMAP/IMAP endpoints, the Garage
  live-integration test, and the spool-migration tool are follow-ups.

- New: **Rspamd spam scoring** at DATA and **MTA-STS** policy serving
  (Phase 1 M4b), finishing M4's deferrals. On the MX role, after
  SPF/DKIM/DMARC, `alo-smtp` consults Rspamd over `POST /checkv2`
  (`ALO_SMTP_RSPAMD_URL`): a `reject` action refuses with **550**,
  `soft reject`/`greylist` defer with **451**, and otherwise the message
  is accepted with the score recorded as an `x-spam` method in
  `Authentication-Results`. A scanner that is unreachable, slow, or
  answers unparseably **fails closed** (451) — configuring a scanner and
  having it down never silently disables filtering. Scanning is off
  until the URL is set (`ALO_SMTP_RSPAMD_TIMEOUT_SECS` bounds the
  call). **MTA-STS** (RFC 8461): the policy (`mode`/`mx`/`max_age`, with
  a content-derived `id`) is rendered from config and served at
  `GET /.well-known/mta-sts.txt` on `ALO_SMTP_MTA_STS_ADDR` (plaintext
  behind the deploy TLS proxy); knobs `ALO_SMTP_MTA_STS_MODE/MX/
  MAX_AGE/ID`, with the `_mta-sts` and `mta-sts` DNS records documented
  in `docs/interop.md`. ARC, TLS-RPT reporting, and DMARC report
  delivery remain deferred (see ROADMAP).

- New: `alo-auth-mail` — the email-authentication trust stack (Phase
  1 M4), wired into `alo-smtp`. Inbound (MX) at DATA: **SPF** (RFC
  7208 full `check_host` with macro expansion and the 10-DNS-lookup /
  2-void-lookup hard limits), **DKIM** verification (RFC 6376 + Ed25519
  per RFC 8463; relaxed/simple canonicalization, `l=`/`x=`, multiple
  signatures), and **DMARC** (RFC 7489; public-suffix org-domain,
  relaxed/strict alignment, `p=reject` → 550, with `pct=` sampling per
  §6.6.4 so a sender mid-rollout is not enforced at 100%). Every verdict
  is recorded in **`Authentication-Results`** (RFC 8601) — the public
  contract downstream parses — plus a `Received-SPF` header; any
  pre-existing `Authentication-Results` bearing our authserv-id (and any
  `Received-SPF`) is stripped from inbound mail first (RFC 8601 §5) so a
  remote sender cannot forge the verdict. A DKIM signature whose `h=`
  omits `From` is a permfail (RFC 6376 §6.1.1). Outbound
  (submission): **DKIM signing** with RSA-2048 or Ed25519, keys
  addressed by `(domain, selector)` behind a `KeyStore` (file backend
  with permission checks and zeroizing buffers) so rotation is a config
  change. RSA uses `ring` (constant-time), not the `rsa` crate
  (RUSTSEC-2023-0071). New knobs: `ALO_SMTP_DKIM_DOMAIN/SELECTOR/KEY/
  ALGORITHM`. DMARC report delivery, ARC, MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, and Rspamd
  are deferred (see ROADMAP).

- New: `alo-smtp` TLS and authenticated submission (Phase 1 M3).
  **STARTTLS** (RFC 3207) on the MX and submission ports and **implicit
  TLS** (port 465), via rustls with the ring provider — pure Rust, no
  OpenSSL. A PEM certificate/key is loaded from disk
  (`ALO_SMTP_TLS_CERT`/`ALO_SMTP_TLS_KEY`) or a self-signed one is
  generated for development. **AUTH PLAIN and LOGIN** (RFC 4954),
  offered only on a submission port over active TLS; wrong password and
  unknown user are indistinguishable (535, anti-enumeration).
  **Submission listeners** (`ALO_SMTP_SUBMISSION_ADDR` for STARTTLS,
  `ALO_SMTP_IMPLICIT_TLS_ADDR` for 465) require authentication before
  MAIL (530) — closing the open-relay hole ahead of enabling outbound.
  Credentials come from `ALO_SMTP_CREDENTIALS_FILE` (a dev bootstrap;
  alo-identity replaces it in M9). **RFC 6409** submission fixups add
  a `Date:` and `Message-ID:` when absent. EHLO now advertises a
  truthful capability set (STARTTLS/AUTH/SIZE/8BITMIME) reflecting the
  connection's exact state, and MAIL accepts `SIZE=`/`BODY=`/`AUTH=`
  parameters for the advertised extensions. `Received:` records
  `ESMTPS` for TLS-protected sessions (RFC 3848).
- New: `alo-smtp` outbound delivery (Phase 1 M2) — a durable queue
  over the spool relays accepted mail. MX resolution (RFC 5321 §5.1:
  preference order, implicit MX, RFC 7505 null-MX = permanent),
  outbound SMTP client with RFC 5321 §4.5.3.2 timeouts and
  dot-stuffing, exponential backoff with jitter (4xx transient vs 5xx
  permanent), per-recipient durable state so a partial delivery never
  re-sends to already-delivered recipients, and RFC 3464 DSN bounces
  from the null sender (never bouncing a null-sender message, §4.5.5).
  **Relay safety: outbound is OFF by default** — enabled only via
  `ALO_SMTP_OUTBOUND_ENABLED=true`, because open relaying must wait
  for the AUTH gate (M3). `ALO_SMTP_SMARTHOST` routes all mail to
  one host (self-hosted mode). Knobs: `ALO_SMTP_RETRY_BASE_SECS`,
  `ALO_SMTP_RETRY_CAP_SECS`, `ALO_SMTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`,
  `ALO_SMTP_QUEUE_INTERVAL_SECS`. Domainless recipients (bare
  `postmaster`) are parked pending local delivery (M5), never dropped.
- New: `alo-smtp` receives mail end-to-end (Phase 1 M1) — full
  MAIL FROM / RCPT TO / DATA transactions with RFC 5321 sequencing
  (503 on out-of-order commands), address parsing incl. quoted local
  parts, address literals, source routes, the null sender and
  `<postmaster>`; DATA with dot-unstuffing, the size limit enforced
  during read (552), and bare-line-ending rejection (SMTP-smuggling
  defense); a `Received:` header stamped on every accepted message;
  durable maildir-style spool (`ALO_SMTP_SPOOL_DIR`) with fsync +
  atomic-rename commit. New knobs: `ALO_SMTP_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`
  (default 25 MiB), `ALO_SMTP_MAX_RCPT` (default 100). HELO, RSET,
  NOOP, VRFY (252, anti-enumeration), HELP/EXPN → 502.
- New: `alo-smtp` service — accepts TCP connections on port 2525,
  greets with a 220 banner, and answers EHLO and QUIT with
  RFC 5321-correct replies. Enforces the 512-octet command-line limit
  during read, rejects bare-LF line endings (SMTP-smuggling defense),
  and closes idle sessions after 5 minutes with 421. Configuration:
  `ALO_SMTP_ADDR`, `ALO_SMTP_HOSTNAME`. `--healthcheck` flag
  probes a running instance for container health.
- New: `deploy/docker-compose.yml` — the pinned engine set (Synapse
  v1.157.1, LiveKit v1.13.4, Collabora CODE 25.04.9.4.1, Garage
  v2.3.0, PostgreSQL 16.14, Rspamd 4.1.2) plus alo-smtp, with
  healthchecks and `.env.example`.
- New: `scripts/fetch-engines.sh` — clones engine sources into
  `../engines` (read-only reference) at exactly the compose-pinned
  versions.
- New: CI runs the quality gate on every PR; releases build from tags
  only.
